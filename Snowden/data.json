Multiple times in the Bible we are told to flee from sexual immorality, And in the Old Testament, Extreme punishments were given for those who practiced homosexuality. The temptation itself is not a sin, The wrong part comes in when you choose to go along with the temptation. Bible verses showing homosexuality is wrong are Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, And 1 Timothy 1:10."}, {"title": "I don't hate gays,", "body": "Let me make this real clear: I don't hate homosexuals, Bisexuals asexuals, All the other sexuals or transgenders. I just disagree with their sense of right and wrong. And either it's the world's biggest coincidence or the USA turned into a hellhole shortly after Barack Obama or the Supreme Court or whatever legalized gay marriage. I don't blame gays for this. I blame Obama."}, {"title": "Its homosexuality, Not the homosexual that is evil", "body": "For the past few decades we have seen a ever growing trend to accept the practice of homosexuality. This however is a dangerous one. With the LGBTQ+ movement leading the charge, It wishes to re define the meaning of marriage, Family, Sex and the difference between man and womanhood. Firstly, With the subject of marriage. Within our Western culture, For centuries, Marriage has always been seen as an institution for a man and women to raise a family. To this day it is still the best way to raise children hands down. Now apart from a very few exceptions a same sex marriage can not provide that for obvious reasons. Upon the subject of sex, Gay sex can not be seen as moral as it does not allow the procreation of children. One cannot just separate procreation and pleasure as otherwise sex becomes meaningless and casual. The effects of the sexual revelation can be seen today, With the rise of STDs, Teenage pregnancy, Rise of abortions, Pornography, Sex trafficking and the list goes on. Moreover it is visible within LGBTQ+ organised Pride parades that sexual deviancy is promoted by a visible few, Which then increases the number of problems that I have already stated. However it must be understood that one should NEVER hate or hurt anyone who commits these acts of sexual disorder, As heterosexuals can be just as bad, But we should help correct each other with compassion."}, {"title": "Nothing is wrong nor right", "body": "We live in a modern society were we consider things to be correct or incorrect. However, This modern system is biased towards many things. Whereas humans have adjusted to these things in a certain manner to determine the role of an object. For example; A tooth brush. It can be used for many different things, However most consider it to be used as a utensil to clean the inner caverns of our mouths. Moving towards this topic, Sexuality is but a biased thing in our modern society. To conclude, Nothing is correct or incorrect. It is just a manner of how we as a modern society consider things."}, {"title": "How do you know your gender and sex don't match?", "body": "A person came to our school to do a presentation on the LGBTQ+. She explained that if a person doesn't feel that their gender matches the one they are assigned at birth, We can change our gender. But the thing is, How do you know that your gender and sex don't match? Is it simply that you want to be another sex, For example, You're a girl and you really want to be a boy."}, {"title": "People are people, Their choices are either net good or bad.", "body": "There isn't any grey area where a person can openly throw out morality in one area so long as they pay it off in other areas. Each decision individually is tested against the limits of morality, And if you fall outside those limits you risk being burned. People know beforehand the consequences of choosing a deviant sexual relationship (they could choose any). It doesn't have to even be homosexual. The worst part of a homosexual relationship is that you bring another person down to your level \u2026 like using (drugs) with another person. In doing anything with them you empower them and make them feel like its normal and ok. Then that sentiment sticks with them like any addiction. Hell, People with addictions even think sometimes they were born that way, Predestined to use, As if they have nowhere else to turn. Its all just a denial to help justify to themselves what they are doing. The problems are self evident:1) Over emphasis on sexual pleasures \u2026 ones that can never amount to offspring as it was meant to (you can buck Darwinism if you don't like that). 2) you deprive yourself the true balance of having a hetero relationship. 3) You open yourself up to throwing out other good guidance from sources such as the bible, Just because it doesn't reflect the way you want to be. 4) You act against the idea that people are unique in that you have determined that there is no opposite sex partner for you. (prison stats clearly demonstrate that homosexuality is situational based \u2026 or worse that if people are born this way that they are also predisposed criminals)   Predisposition for crime though might support what I said above in all the other points, Though im not saying that they have that at this point. 5) Exhibit selfishness in that they are willing to walk such a hard uphill battle against nature for their own sexual pleasure. Or the fact that they don't walk what they perceive to be an even harder line by following through with the morally right path that's been presented to them. Just all round its a very belittling practice. It doesn't buy any respect for the human race, It makes us look like animals. It demonstrates that we can't handle emotions or look past our basic instincts. Its primal and disgusting, As primal and disgusting as violence against innocents is. Everytime I see it it makes me lose faith in mankind. Worse yet seeing it propped up by a morally flawed society as if a social norm."}, {"title": "LGBTQ+ is spreading the wrong message", "body": "Young children in elementary school are now being exposed to the LGBTQ community. This is dangerous, Manipulative, And damaging to our society. Children as young as 7 are claiming that they are trans, Gay, Lesbian, Etc. This is ridiculous. These children are far too young to know what gender they like or if they are in fact the opposite gender. A 7 year old should have no attraction whatsoever to another person in terms of a relationship, Serious or sexual. However, The LGBTQ community and their message spreading is enabling our youth to learn about these topics. When these children are influenced, They listen, As they are easily manipulated. This is turning people who may not be LGBTQ into members of the community. If we want a generation of delusional and wrongly influenced youth, Then yes, LGBTQ is great. However, That is not what we want, And the LGBTQ community stands in the way of a community that is born of free choice, Influencing children at such a young age."}, {"title": "But only the movement", "body": "On their own the people in these groups aren't too bad but the movement is the problem. Most LGBTQ+ people just want to get on with their lives without worry. The LGBTQ+ movement however undermines that by trying to force society to submit to their ideology. The movement (which btw is made up mostly of non-LGBTQ+ people) attacks people for the most trivial of mistakes. Trans woman: how dare you call me sir I'm gonna have a mob beat you up and then have you arrested. Or something similar."}, {"title": "I don't hate them for their sexuality, Just their actions", "body": "I don't hate anyone for their sexuality. They could be sexually attracted to trains for all I care, Honestly. I'm a Christian and I believe Love Is Love. That being said, The LGBTQABCDEFG community has gotten out of hand, Especially within these past couple of years. They are primarily responsible for \"cancel culture\" a situation that affects even small people just scrounging for money as artists and such. They are obsessed with only pushing their agenda. . . Their morals. It sucks. I had a Christian friend who literally stopped accepting herself as an LGBT individual because of how they treated our religion."}, {"title": "My rights are gendergay", "body": "It's wrong to deny me my LGBTQ rights. Gender bigots have gender hatred, Which means that I can't express my rights. I need to express myself through sex, And I'm not going to let Trump fukcs tell me I can't. My rights are gendergay, And your rights are pathetic. People are trying to ignore my rights to genderqueer sex. They other me, And instead talk about less important issues like the environment and poverty. What use is not being hungry if LGBT folk aren't validated?  I demand my gay rights, And people are just going to have to get used to other issues like low wages and climate change until my rights to sex are validated. Because genderqueer validation is the future."}, {"title": "Now its not cos im homophobic", "body": "Just saying im not homophobic i just think that having a group about it is wrong.

People really get mad because I\u2019ve never heard of gender fluid or GTx or whatever they come up with like can I honestly be a person who doesn\u2019t care about someone gotta say? Leave straight people alone. Don\u2019t force me to choose anything. I want to be myself. I don\u2019t have to care about whatever gender or whatever sexuality you just came up with.

But after they got their rights, Now they want full control. They are just greedy, Lusty, Slothful, Full of vanity, Wrathful when we disagree with them, Definitely prideful, All of the seven deadly sins is shown through their actions. They are wrong in every way. They think they are born gay, Bi etc. But they aren't. They think kids should be sexualized, Which is immoral and wrong. They think they can force us to date trannies which is a big f**k NO to them. They think we are scared of them. That is their biggest most hypocritical mistake. Why? Because they are the ones crying wolf that they are being oppressed when they are actually the violent ones. Lgbtqpedos are under the influence of the Devil in Christians' eyes and speaking of which, They disrespect Christians and Scientists, Claiming they know more than us normies and the professionals. Well, Our common sense tells us, These lgbtqpedos are not normal, They never have nor ever will be. Lgbtqpedos and their worldly indoctrination should be purged. All of it. Not a trace should be left because they intend to wipe out our history, Our heterosexuality, Our way of life, Our family structure that is natural and good, They intend to alternate everything, Force everyone to be gay/trans etc for \"population control\". Thing is, People die every day, Whether in war, By poverty, By disease, Old age etc, That's why we have new babies coming in. Everything lgbtqpedos are fighting for is toxic and a lie. Monogamy and heterosexual love is truth, Balanced, Natural and right. Everything lgbtqpedos has done is unnatural, Evil and immoral. We are already stopping them and we will continue until they are fully gone. Offended snowflakes? I don't care about your shallow sensitivity.

Members of the LGBT community are far more likely to feel depressed, Have suicidal thoughts (and higher suicide rates too), Have STDs like AIDS, Are way more likely to be child predators and be obese. This all shows that there's a clear link between these abnormal thoughts/actions and being LGBT. Also it is clearly unnatural, We are social creatures by nature's design and our anatomy is such that we are compatible with the opposite sex, Not just when looking at our sexual organs, But when considering our physical and emotional strengths as well. As for the \"T\", It is a damaging procedure that has higher rates post-surgery than before and doesn't even affect the chromosomes in one's body - it is glorified plastic surgery that is for some reason being advertised to children. We also see that trans-athletes far outperform other women, Which is demoralising at best and straight up dangerous when considering combat sports.

Those who are transgender or non-binary -Have a medical condtion called gender dysphoria that makes them feel like their body and pronouns are incorrect ones, So sometimes the adjust to feel better. This helps them be happy and fufilled - a way to cope with their conidtion, Which is never wrong as it harms none.

In this instance, The murderer has inflicted a massive amount of harm against an individual by ending their life, And against the individual's loved ones by depriving them of that individual. In other words, Only when the harm caused by an action is equivalent to taking a life should a death penalty be considered. It goes without saying that sexual practices or gender identity can never fulfill this standard. Nobody dies as a result of being too close to people who are having gay sex. Nobody dies as a result of passing by a transgender person in the street. The opposition states that these are \"dangerous ideologies\" perpetuated by \"cultural Marxists\". This is patently false, As gay sex has been observed both in nature and in societies that developed before Karl Marx's writings or any of their derivatives. The statement that gay sex \"spreads sexually transmitted diseases\" is irrelevant, As any kind of sex is capable of spreading disease without proper protection and testing. The claim that it \"lessens population growth\" is similarly useless, As population growth reduces in response to a vast number of other variables, Most notably education and standard of living. Blaming gay people for a decrease in population growth arbitrarily ignores the other, More substantive influences. The claim that either gay or transgender people are \"degenerating the nation\" is entirely without substantiation. The opposition does not care, Of course, Because the intent is only to latch onto a convenient scapegoat for the systemic failures of late-stage capitalism. The claim that sexual and gender minorities are grasping for privileges as the cost of the majority is just as unfounded as the rest. The only \"privilege\" I have ever seen agitated for is the privilege to live without the threat of violence or oppression. Clearly the opposition does not respect the right of other people to live as they see fit. It is my opinion that those the opposition threatens should respond in kind.

And if you are a man of reason explain to me how a person being sexually attracted to the same gender not scientific, Its same as how you crave food and you say you are hungry not knowing the system of your own biological body. 4.

You can see that in the last week the protests have become less violent, Coincidentally just as the police force in the USA becomes more civil as they are globally condemned for their response to the protests. Some statues have been removed, However many protestors instead want people to recognise that the historical people we hold up as champions were not perfect, And had some deep flaws based on society at the time. Just as many are requesting that especially egregious figures instead be replaced by equally as important figures who didn't hold white supremacist views. Although White individuals may be killed more often by Police than Black individuals, You would expect this when they make up around 60% of the population compared to 26%. When taking into consideration percent of the population by skin colour, Black individuals are 3 times as more likely to be killed than their White colleagues. Police are also not charged 99% of the time, Which shows just how much they get away with. At most they may have to switch county, But they are still able to remain police officers. ISIS tries to kill people while Black Lives Mater doesn't, So there is no sane comparison.

White people make up 72% of the American population while African-Americans make up only around 12. 3%. In 2019 alone 1, 089 people were killed as a result of police brutality. Likewise, African American's made up 24% of that 1, 089. In other words, African American's make up less than 1/5 of our population but nearly a quarter of our police brutality deaths. In my opinion, Police brutality in any aspect, Towards any group of people is unacceptable, However because of the data it is clear to see that African American's are far more likely to be injured of killed as a result of police brutality than white people. In addition, While opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, People will also say \"Well black people kill more black people\" and while that is true it is also a fact that white people kill more white people, It's simple demographics. People are more likely to kill those in their general area. Saying Black Lives Matter does not mean that all other lives matter. Of course white lives matter but the difference is that white people have never in history been oppressed, Segregated, Enslaved, Or discriminated against because of the color of their skin. If your child died and you were giving a speech and you said \"My child was incredibly special\" wouldn't it be rude and appalling for someone to say \"All children matter! \". . . Of course all children matter but in this scenario we're talking about the child who has died. If a house in a neighborhood was on fire you wouldn't run to put water on all of the houses. Instead you'd put water on the house that's on fire. It doesn't mean all of the other houses don't matter, It just means we are focusing on the one who is in extreme danger. For the Christians out there, Jesus would leave his 99 other sheep to go save the one that was in danger.

It does sound like Sci-fi, Also given the fact that writer Isaac Asimov is credited with the idea of space-based solar power projects since 1941 (that\u2019s the year he wrote his short story Reason that explores the topic). However, It is not. Space-based solar power (SBSP) is not a new idea and it involves collecting the sun\u2019s energy while in space and wirelessly transmitting it back to Earth. The SBSP tech uses \u201csolar panels to collect solar energy in space with reflectors of inflatable mirrors that direct solar radiation onto solar panels and then beaming it on Earth through a microwave or laser. The energy is then received on Earth via a microwave antenna\u201d according to a blog post on the website Greenmatch. And it seems like the Chinese scientists are determined to prove the technology right. Between 2021 and 2025, According to an article from The Sydney Morning Herald, They first plan to build small and medium-sized solar power stations and subsequently launch them to the stratosphere to generate electricity. And the next step is to build a Megawatt level space solar power station by 2030. Thus, Probably becoming the first country with an operational solar power station in space that actually produces electricity. And what exactly is the EU doing on the matter? There are some individual projects, Like France\u2019s Eutelsat investment, But nothing anywhere near the Chinese endeavour. This makes me also wonder\u2026   while we, In Europe, Argue about which one is the cheapest, Safest and cleanest source of renewable energy on Earth (hydrogen, Solar, Wind, Nuclear), Did China just changed the game (and its terrain) underneath our noses and is about to leave us all behind?

However, Things didn't end so cleanly in one of Star Trek's many divergent timelines. Writer Michael Jan Friedman and artist Peter Krause explore the answers to these daunting questions in their 1993 Star Trek: The Next Generation storyline \"The Worst of Both Worlds, \" which ran from Star Trek: TNG #47-50. The story begins on the Enterprise years after the events of \"The Best of Both Worlds. \" Picard and crew are on a fairly routine mission to Mardion Three, Which is uncomfortably close to Wolf 359, Where they once fought the Borg. Suddenly, They are pulled into an \"anomaly\" which pulls them into an alternate dimension. Before Picard and Riker can begin to understand what's happened, They encounter a second Enterprise which quickly beams them aboard.

When Ephraim first encounters Dot, Kirk can be seen in the background talking to Khan Noonien Singh during the events of the Star Trek episode \u201cSpace Seed. \u201d Later, Kirk can be seen in the background again, This time being held at swordpoint by a shirtless Mr. Sulu during the events of \u201cThe Naked Time. \u201dAs Ephraim chases the Enterprise through the galaxy, Other references to classic Star Trek episodes appear.

When Ephraim catches up with the ship and gets back aboard, She encounters Dot again. Their conflict ends when the Enterprise self-destruct sequence is activated and the ship crashes on a nearby planet as it did in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.

Quinto mentioned having found decapitated action figures in his mailbox every morning, And Chris Pine complained about having received notes tied to rocks that were thrown at his windows, But only scratching them, Not breaking them, Since they didn't throw hard enough - all of which has resulted in death stares from the insulted Trekkies. Finally, They simply express hope that these fans will still come to see the movie. In the background, A rather familiar voice assures the two that \"they will come\", And Leonard Nimoy appears - at which point the two previously angered Trekkies are visibly overcome with joy (combining Vulcan salutes with a rather un-Vulcan like display of emotion) - and states that in time Chris Pine will be accepted as equal to the original Kirk, While Zachary Quinto will be viewed as \"slightly less\" than equal to the original Spock, But \"ultimately OK\". Nimoy attempts to assure Quinto that fans will like the movie because to not like it would not be \"illogical\" as host Seth Meyers suggests (having interrupted Nimoy, Beaming at the idea of beating Spock himself to the logic-based punchline), But rather \"would make them dickheads\" - a sentiment that, Coming from their hero, The Trekkies in the audience heartily accept.

With fusion reactions usually taking place at millions of degrees and huge pressures, Their declaration was greeted with enormous excitement by the scientific community. Unfortunately, No one could reproduce their results, Leading to their findings being dismissed and discredited.

Ah, But Quentin Tarantino has already said if he does make a Star Trek it would be set in the so-called \u201cKelvin Timeline\u201d with Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, And the rest of the modern cast. So the Pine Directive is of vital importance at this juncture. Someone needs to make Tarantino aware of it as soon as possible. Furthermore, The Pine Directive may have uses beyond the Star Trek universe. Imagine if there was a way to predict whether a movie would be good or bad purely by the part in Chris Pine\u2019s hair.

Part of it may have been because Home Video was becoming the latest craze, But it still can't be argued that throughout the 70's and most of the 80's the movie studios released less than 150-200 titles per year (In 2009 the average was over 600) and each of those films grossing around 10 million on average in that nearly 20 year span compared to the overblown market now. The year 1984 in particular stands out as a year that was so full of movies that are memorable and most people have seen. I haven't even seen all of the films on this list yet, But am aware of them, And hope to see the few I haven't or have not in so long. It's so hard to believe that in a time when less than 200 movies were released on average per year, This many movies managed to not only turn an average profit at the box office of about 15-20 million dollars (Not counting the huge numbers that pulled in close to or over 100 million on their own at a time when the average budget was 5-10 million).

As to why the Enterprise still exists when the Federation does not, Well the answer is that anyone traveling at warp speed when the change in the timeline occurred is immune.

The main protagonist of STTB is Tiberius Chase, A top-gun starfighter pilot in the United Earth Stellar Navy. This is the early days of the so-called Coalition of Planets, And the Earth military has yet to merge with Starfleet, Which is still strictly an exploratory organization at this point. While most of the cast is brand-new characters, There are appearances from a couple of familiar faces, Including the Andorian Commander Shran (played by Jeffrey Combs in Enterprise), And Vulcan Ambassador Skon, Who is the father of Sarek (who is, Of course, The father of Spock). Enterprise\u2018s Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) is referenced but not seen: once hostilities break out with the Romulans, It\u2019s mentioned that the Enterprise is visiting Risa and too far away to be of any help. The script opens with Chase competing in a sailboat race against several other UESN cadets, And we see Chase demonstrate both the leadership and the cunning refusal to lose that we know so well from one James Tiberius Kirk. Unfortunately, While Tiberius is a brilliant pilot, He\u2019s being held back by his family: he grew up among some hardcore Earth-first xenophobes, And the brass of UESN don\u2019t trust him or intend to let him forget it. We meet several of Chase\u2019s friends and peers over the course of script, But Chase is by far the major player, And it\u2019s his actions \u2014 and his disregard for the chain of command \u2014 that eventually turns the tide in the brewing war between Earth and the attacking Romulans.

Dr. White is currently running the White\u2013Juday warp-field interferometer experiment in order to develop a proof of concept for Alcubierre-style warp travel, If possible. The Alcubierre drive uses exotic matter (not to be confused with antimatter) to travel faster than light. While the concept had been out since 2008 the design of IXS Enterprise was popularized in June 2015 after a series of media outlets reported on the conceptual artwork done by Dutch artist Mark Rademaker in collaboration with NASA. [1] According to Mark Rademaker, Over 1, 600 hours have been spent on the conceptual artwork that he created. [2]The energy required to power the warp drive, According to White, [3] is approximately the negative (negative energy is required for the Alcubierre drive concept to function) mass\u2013energy equivalence of Voyager 1, Which has a mass of approximately 700 kilograms. Using E=mc2, \u2212700 kilograms of mass is equivalent to ~\u221263 exajoules of energy (this number is not definitive and can be further reduced).

James Tibirius Kirk, On the other hand would be VERY upset with the idea that Titan AE presented. He would know that there is hope for Earth's survival against the mighty Drej Mothership, Alahenena. Kirk would have beaten the Drej in time to save Earth because he would quickly come up with the use of his engines and delfector dish on his refit Enterprise or Enterprise-A to drain the Alahenena and win, Plus save our planet! That is because Kirk does not believe in the \"no win\" scenario, Passing the Kobayasi Maru Test all three times he took it with flying colors.

However, It is not. Space-based solar power (SBSP) is not a new idea and it involves collecting the sun\u2019s energy while in space and wirelessly transmitting it back to Earth. The SBSP tech uses \u201csolar panels to collect solar energy in space with reflectors of inflatable mirrors that direct solar radiation onto solar panels and then beaming it on Earth through a microwave or laser. The energy is then received on Earth via a microwave antenna\u201d according to a blog post on the website Greenmatch.

It's an oversimplification to suggest that the overall brilliance of Season 4 is the direct result of Ryan joining the cast, But no matter how much of it you attribute to her, It's a phenomenal season of television, Filled from start to finish with some of the best \"Voyager\" episodes (and also \"Retrospect, \" but we don't talk about that one).

One reason it's important to watch Season 4 of \"DS9\" prior to watching \"First Contact, \" the second film starring the \"Next Generation\" cast, Is because in order to include Worf in the story, The latter is obligated to include a scene in which the Enterprise rescues another ship called the Defiant, Introduced in \"DS9\" and captained by Worf himself. Future \"Next Generation\" movies, Which decline in quality moving forward, Come up with increasingly hand-wavy reasons for his presence on the Enterprise bridge. \"First Contact\" itself, However, Is by far the best of the \"Next Generation\" films and one of the best \"Star Trek\" films in general, As the crew travels back in time to prevent the cybernetic hive mind known as the Borg from altering history. Not only is \"First Contact\" a great movie (and the film directorial debut of Jonathan Frakes, Who plays Commander William Riker), It also kicks off a spectacular \"Star Trek\" run that can stand up against any other period in franchise history. Deep Space Nine (Season 5) / Voyager (Season 3)With Season 5, \"DS9\" gets back on track after the previous outlier season, Quickly focusing around a single unified threat thanks to an alliance between the show's original antagonists the Cardassians and the Dominion. The presence of the sinister Changelings adds an intrigue element to the story, As any character could potentially be a Changeling in disguise \u2014 a concept that would be used to great effect years later in the 2004 reboot of \"Battlestar Galactica. \" The season concludes with the official start of the Dominion War, A conflict that would dominate the remainder of the show. \"Voyager, \" meanwhile, Was also getting back on track in its third season, Which generally sees an uptick in quality \u2014 particularly toward the end, With episodes like \"Before and After, \" \"Real Life, \" and \"Worst Case Scenario. \" Robert Picardo, Who plays Voyager's holographic doctor, Also gets to make a cameo in \"DS9\" as the Doctor's creator, Lewis Zimmerman, In the episode \"Doctor Bashir, I presume. \" And Season 3 ends with the first installment of \"Scorpion, \" which catalyzed \"Voyager's\" official rise to greatness in part thanks to a memorable new character. \""}, {"title": "The Correct Order in Which to Watch the Entire Star Trek Franchise - Part 6", "body": "Deep Space Nine (Season 3) / Voyager (Season 1)Once again, It's time to switch between two seasons of \"Star Trek, \" as the third season of \"DS9\" overlaps with the debuting \"Star Trek: Voyager. \" The first \"Trek\" series to feature a woman (Kathryn Janeway) in the captain's chair, \"Voyager\" also had a unique and fascinating premise. Much of the \"DS9\" action is driven by the existence of a nearby wormhole that leads to the Gamma Quadrant, A section of space far away from the Federation's native Alpha Quadrant. This allows the titular space station and its intrepid crew to encounter any number of new and dangerous alien species. \"Voyager\" goes even farther, Literally \u2014 a solitary ship finds itself transported to the even more distant Delta Quadrant and spends the rest of the series trying to get home. Due to this premise, There's no reason whatsoever to jump between individual episodes of these two seasons, As the events of one show don't affect the other in any way. But jumping between shows by the season provides a fun and accurate experience of what it was like to watch the interlocking \"Star Trek\" programs of the 1990s. Deep Space Nine (Season 4) / Voyager (Season 2)Like most \"Star Trek\" shows, \"Voyager\" takes a couple of seasons to find its feet, And Season 2 in particular contains some of its most notoriously bad episodes, From the tone-deaf Native American implications of \"Tattoo\" to Janeway and Voyager pilot Tom Paris turning into salamanders and having salamander babies together in \"Threshold\" to the utter abomination that is \"Tuvix. \" At least it has the consideration to get them all out of the way early on. \"DS9, \" meanwhile, Was encountering its own problems in Season 4, Which took a sharp turn away from the burgeoning conflict with the Dominion and instead spent most of its time dealing with the newly antagonistic Klingon Empire. Fortunately, Even as the overarching plot went briefly off the rails, The writing was getting better and better, And the diversion is, If nothing else, Entertaining. As a bonus, Season 4 features one of television's first lesbian kisses, And also brings in Worf, The Klingon security officer from \"Next Generation\" \u2014 until Picard, Michael Dorn was the only actor to star in the main casts of two different \"Star Trek\" shows. \""}, {"title": "The Correct Order in Which to Watch the Star Trek Franchise - Part   5", "body": "The Next Generation (Season 7) / Deep Space Nine (Season 2)Similarly, The second season of \"DS9\" coincides with the last \"Next Generation\" season. While it might lack the standout episodes of earlier seasons, Season 7 manages a few achievements. For one thing, It puts a bow on one of the most beloved shows in television history with a flourish, Ending the program with an ambitious, Timeline-jumping two-parter that ties directly into the events of the very first episode. It also inadvertently lays the groundwork for a much more modern \"Trek\" show with an episode about junior officers called \"Lower Decks. \" But most importantly, It ties into and reinforces \"Deep Space Nine, \" most notably in the penultimate episode \"Preemptive Strike, \" which deals with concurrent \"DS9\" problems like the Cardassians and the Maquis. By the end of Season 2, \"DS9\" has already proven capable of standing on its own, Having picked up and ran with the Maquis threads from earlier \"Next Generation\" episodes, Returned to the Mirror Universe first introduced in the original series, And introduced the Dominion and the Jem'Hadar, Who will serve as the series' primary antagonists. But the stories of Picard and company were far from over. . . GenerationsThe four feature films built around the cast of \"Next Generation\" are a direct continuation of the movies that came before, Not least because the first one, 1994's \"Generations, \" serves as a bridge between \"TOS\" and its descendant, And between Kirk and Picard, In about the most literal way you could imagine. This movie marks the final appearance of several characters from the original show, Including Kirk himself (the one played by William Shatner, At any rate) which makes it a crucial piece of the \"Star Trek\" timeline, As does the introduction of Data's emotion chip. Of course, Some might consider the movie worth it just to see Malcolm McDowell chew the scenery like he hasn't eaten in three days, And we can't say they're wrong. \"Generations\" launched Picard's crew onto the big screen almost immediately after their exit from the small one, Meaning they would continue to be the face of \"Star Trek\"\u00a0for the remainder of the decade.

If any one series beyond the original can lay a claim to being the single most iconic \"Star Trek\" story, It's Next Generation, Which premiered in 1987 and went on to not only have seven seasons of its own, But to jumpstart a chain of interlocking \"Star Trek\" shows that would thoroughly dominate the 1990s. Before that, Though, The first five seasons of Next Generation stood alone, And if you're trying to get somebody instantly hooked on Trek, This might actually be the place to start, Despite the fact that the first couple of seasons don't hold up incredibly well.

The Next Generation (Season 6) / Deep Space Nine (Season 1)Okay, This is where it gets weird. \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" debuted in January 1993, Just a few months after \"Next Generation\" kicked off its sixth season \u2014 a season full of unmitigated classics, Incidentally, From the return of Montgomery Scott in \"Relics\" to the legendary two-parter \"Chain of Command. \" Picard even makes a cameo in the first episode of \"DS9, \" which takes place aboard a space station and uses the ideas and events of earlier \"Next Generation\" episodes to inform characters like Commander Benjamin Sisko and Quark. It's essentially impossible to understand Sisko's backstory, For example, Without first having seen the \"Next Generation\" episode \"The Best of Both Worlds. \"Despite the fact that they take place over roughly the same time period, We recommend watching the entirety of Season 6 of \"Next Generation\" followed by the entirety of Season 1 of \"DS9, \" if for no other reason than the former has more episodes than the latter, Making it a complicated process to intercut between them.

The Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock, And The Voyage Home essentially form their own trilogy of movies within the larger \"Trek\" saga, And are some of the most popular and critically acclaimed installments in the franchise. \"The Wrath of Khan, \" in particular, Tends to show up near the top of \"best science fiction films in history\" lists, Making the titular Khan such an iconic villain that he was recast for the J.

Then, In 2017, The drought ended with the premiere of \"\"Star Trek: Discovery, \" and when it rains, It pours. \"Discovery\" heralded the arrival of a whole new era of \"\"Star Trek, \" and that's just the beginning \u2014 Paramount+ will soon play host to two new \"Star Trek\" shows, With three more currently in development, And there's a new movie scheduled for release in 2023.

The first two seasons, In particular, Are absolutely riddled with classic episodes, And while the third season is significantly worse due to changes in the creative team, It's still fun to watch William Shatner ham it up as Captain Kirk, Leonard Nimoy raise a single Vulcan eyebrow as Mr. Spock, And the original Starship Enterprise soar through space.

But I can\u2019t wait 40 years for those two items \u2014 I need them now! Why are we spending all of our scientific resources on things like curing baldness and stopping pandemics when we could be using our research dollars on projects that could actually affect mankind in a positive way \u2014 like creating time machines or light sabers for the general public. And when are they going to come out with a huge floating spaceship that\u2019s like a mini-city? Those things are in about every science fiction show over the past half-century.

Captain Kathryn Janeway's (Kate Mulgrew) series even co-opted the Borg and the Borg Queen, Who were Picard's greatest and most popular enemies. Star Trek: Nemesis was a bid to reassert TNG as the focal point of Star Trek (with the hopes of delivering a 5th TNG movie), But the oversaturation of the franchise created overall fatigue and malaise since so much of Trek felt like it had become redundant. All that Star Trek: Nemesis did was remind fans that TNG's best days were behind them. Nemesis' Failure Made DS9 And Voyager Movies ImpossibleOnce Star Trek: Nemesis became the lowest-grossing film of the franchise, It was over for the Trek movies. But this didn't just end any chances of another TNG movie, Nemesis' collapse also soured Paramount, Star Trek's studio, On any possibility of a big-screen version of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or Star Trek: Voyager. The fanciful idea that each Trek series would follow TNG's course and graduate to a feature film after a seven-year run - if it was ever even seriously considered by the studio - was shot down immediately when the TNG movies began to falter, Starting with Star Trek Insurrection. Star Trek: Nemesis's failure simply confirmed the studio's worst fears that the Star Trek franchise needed to be mothballed. It doesn't seem like there were ever serious plans to bring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or Star Trek: Voyager to the big screen. Instead, The producers decided to include cameos in the TNG films as nods to the spinoffs, Such as DS9's USS Defiant and Voyager's holographic Doctor (Robert Picardo) appearing in Star Trek: First Contact. Because of her popularity, Jeri Ryan was asked to cameo as Seven of Nine in Star Trek: Nemesis but she refused because her reclaimed Borg heroine had never met anyone on TNG and it didn't make sense. Instead, Kate Mulgrew did the honors and made a brief appearance as Admiral Janeway in Nemesis. This is very likely going to be the only times the characters from the TNG era spinoffs make movie appearances.

Director Stuart Baird didn't understand\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0and the producers' desire to deliver an action movie resulted in sequences like dune buggy chases and interminably long starship battles (which, Again, Echoed\u00a0Wrath of Khan). Meanwhile, The murky themes of\u00a0Star Trek: Nemesis, Which was ultimately about Picard confronting an evil version of himself and suffering a tragic loss but finding the will to continue boldly going where no one has gone before, Were lost in the complicated and dreary plot involving Shinzon wanting to destroy Picard and the United Federation of Planets.

The purported rewrite, Which would have been illegal in the Writer\u2019s Guild, Was believed to have been designed to deny any dramatic or sentimental value to Crosby\u2019s character.

BY JOHN ORQUIOLA\"Star Trek: Enterprise has become an influential Star Trek series that now serves as the canonical springboard for all of Star Trek that follows. A prequel set in the 22nd century, Enterprise was the fifth Star Trek show and the last of the era that launched with Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987. While Enterprise was the only show of the TNG era to last 4 seasons and its cancelation in 2005 marked the end of Star Trek on TV for 12 years, The series has since earned new admirers in the last two decades and the Star Trek franchise has recontextualized Enterprise's greater importance. One of the issues with Star Trek: Enterprise during its initial run is that it came at the tail end of TNG, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, And Star Trek: Voyager each having epic 7-season runs. By the time Enterprise debuted in 2001, There had been over 500 hours of Star Trek on TV and 9 movies. Although Enterprise's 22nd-century setting was meant to give the series and characters a more contemporary feel as the pioneers of human space travel aboard the USS Enterprise NX-01, The show often felt like a watered-down retread of its more innovative predecessors.

Since the film was a combination of all the efforts through the years to bring \u201cStar Trek\u201d back as either a series, A TV movie, Or a feature film, The development process was one-of-a-kind. According to The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cThe Motion Picture\u201d cost $46 million to create \u2014 which included all the development costs from Phase II and the other aborted projects \u2014 and brought in $140 million for Paramount. The film that brought Trek back to the silver screen and into the zeitgeist of popular culture was fraught with delays, Changes, And a stunning last-minute finish. Since Paramount had taken in almost $30 million in advance payment for TMP from movie theaters around the country, If they did not deliver it on time, There would have been a series of damaging lawsuits. While the very existence of Paramount Pictures was tied to the fate of TMP, The very lives of the stars of the film hung in the balance as well. According to William Shatner\u2019s 1994 book, \u201cStar Trek Movie Memories, \u201d the set of the living robot was fraught with danger. \u201dMovie Memories\u201d is among the many Trek-themed books Shatner has written through the years. This book was written with co-author Chris Kreski \u2014 who also helped Shatner write \u201dGet A Life. \u201dAs the story goes, Kirk, Spock, And McCoy finally explore the mind of what they thought was a gigantic living machine who was terrorizing Earth \u2014 named V\u2019Ger. They were joined by Decker (Stephen Collins) and Ilia (Persis Khambatta). As they crept down from the saucer section and climbed down into the heart of the creature, Lightning flashed from above, Lighting their way.

Most football fans had heard of the early picks, Among them Mike Pruitt, Who went to the Browns, And a couple of Ohio State guys, Archie Griffin and Tim Fox. Kirk was fairly well known in southwestern Ohio. Wearing No. 85 as a Dayton Flyers senior, He averaged 24 yards per catch on a team that beat the Akron Zips 31-9. The Flyers didn't pass much. Kirk made only 26 catches. When he dropped all the way to the end of the draft, Salata arranged to fly him to Newport, Beach, Calif. , For a spoof-fest including a parade, Parties, Gifts and celebrities. Salata dreamed up \"Mr. Irrelevant\" from his background as a low draft pick of the Steelers in the 1950s and Hollywood connections based on appearing in films. One of Salata's roles was as a stunt double for Charlton Heston as Moses in 'The Ten Commandments. \" Funny parallel: When initial flight plans to get Kirk to Newport Beach fell through, A temporary double had to be found. Events had been scheduled. A young local butcher with an athletic build was recruited to fill in as Kirk. The butcher was hurried to the airport, Where he was led to a crowd that greeted the first Mr. Irrelevant and rode away in a convertible. Eventually a flight carrying Kirk landed. A switcheroo was pulled in time to get him in most of the scheduled events.

BY SEAN ELLARD\"Star Trek has always been successful at rewarding fans with consistent comforts they\u2019ve come to identify with the brand. Decade after decade, Star Trek has kept essential parts of its universe consistent, Including what things are called. But the origin story of where the Enterprise got its name and why Star Trek keeps using it is steeped in a proud tradition, Legacy and symbolism. So, It is no accident that one of the most famous fictional starships is just as hallowed as its many real predecessors -- but it almost didn\u2019t happen at all. In Star Trek lore the USS Enterprise is a name most associated with Captain Kirk and Picard. But the name has been a constant throughout the more than half-century-old brand. In the Star Trek universe, All major flagships have been called Enterprise, Including the first pre-Starfleet vessel. More recently, The Star Trek: Enterprise put the ship's name right in its title. Enterprise's opening features real footage of NASA\u2019s Enterprise space shuttle. It was the first space vehicle of its kind (although it never flew to space). In 1976, The shuttle earned its name because the \"hundreds of thousands\" of letters the U. S. Government said represented millions of passionate Star Trek fans. The shuttle was originally going to be called Constitution, But President Gerald Ford directed NASA to make the change due to the huge public wave of support. However, The name was familiar to the government. Enterprise has a long tradition in U. S. Military history, Dating back to confederation. In 1775, A group of revolutionary forces led by Benedict Arnold raided a British shipyard in Quebec and stole a sloop-of-war, Liberty, And renamed it, Enterprise. Since then, The name has adorned significant American ships of war for nearly 250 years. Something military veterans like Star Trek\u2019s creator Gene Roddenberry would surely know. Roddenberry served his country in the pacific theater during World War II. In that time, Two very prominent American aircraft carriers, The U. S. S. Enterprise & U. S. S. Yorkton (which tragically sunk), Earned distinguished places in history. Roddenberry initially wanted to call his Star Trek starship the S. S. Yorktown.

Pine was the fourth actor to play the titular character, Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, And Ben Affleck preceding him. Yet again, Pine brings his own flair to an established character and while the movie did not blow the doors off the box office, It was an exciting action-adventure nonetheless. More recently, Pine was cast as Captain Steve Trevor opposite Gal Gadot in \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019. Pine acts as the conduit for the audience entering the world of the Amazons from the outside and in many ways acts as the heart of the film. Pine and Gadot\u2019s chemistry carries the film and is another example of Pine\u2019s versatility, Being able to have a strong relationship that exudes energy from the screen \u2014 Pine reprised his role for the sequel, \u2018Wonder Woman 1984\u2019.

Never once did Pine\u2019s Kirk not feel like he was a different character than who Shatner\u2019s Kirk was which is an issue other franchises have struggled with. The other aspect of Pine\u2019s performance that resonated with audiences was his chemistry with his supporting cast. Pine has a unique back and forth between each of his crewmates aboard the U. S. S. Enterprise including talents such as Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, And Bruce Greenwood. The core of why Pine\u2019s performance works so well is his dynamic with Zachary Quinto\u2019s Spock. The antagonistic relationship that blossoms into a friendship between the two characters propel the story of \u2018Star Trek\u2019 and without the performances of Pine and Quinto, The film would not be nearly as effective nor as entertaining. Pine also brings a physicality that is noteworthy in the action sequences of the film, Selling every jump, Sprint, And punch.

In the latest issue of Marvel Comics' Star Wars: Bounty Hunters, The legendary Trandoshan hunter known as Bossk gets the spotlight, And the issue confirms his similarity to a Star Trek character in a very hilarious way. In the issue, Bossk finds himself competes in the Great Hunt of Malastare, Fighting for his life against a variety of other hunters having been paid by Jabba the Hutt to eliminate some rivals. However, One such battle sees the reptilian hunter facing off with a much larger foe, And it resembles Captain Kirk's battle where he comically fought a Gorn Captain in an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series. In the episode of Star Trek's first season entitled \"Arena\", The crew of the Enterprise found themselves in combat with a vessel belonging to the reptilian species known as the Gorn. However, They both ended up intruding upon an unexplored sector of space guarded by beings known as the Metrons, Who transport Captain Kirk and the Gorn captain to a remote arena and battlefield to face off in a one-on-one brawl, With the victor's ship being allowed to leave while the loser's is destroyed. As such, The following battle is a comically choreographed and slow fight sequence between the captains, Which at one point sees the Gorn captain throwing a large rock at Kirk. As such, The battle is a classic and iconic scene from the original series, And it seemingly gets referenced in this new Star Wars issue from Marvel. In Star Wars: Bounty Hunters #11 from writer Ethan Sacks with art by Paolo Villanelli, Bossk has likewise been thrown into a competition where he's battling for survival. Furthermore, Bossk ends up being at odds with the large Dowutin big-game hunter known as Grummgar (first seen in Star Wars: The Force Awakens in Maz Kanata's castle). While Grummgar demands that Bossk fight with honor, The lethal and cunning Bossk cares little for honor so long as victory is achieved, And his violent response seemingly mirrors the attack of the Gorn captain, Whom he very much resembles being a reptilian himself. \""}, {"title": "More Like Lorca, Less Like Picard, Part 3", "body": "The article lastly says \"And granted, Those characters aren\u2019t likely to lead spinoffs of their own.

Perhaps Starfleet captains forced into leadership positions during times of war and conflict are, Naturally, Harder and less concerned with things like Federation protocol and ethics than those who are not. Maybe they\u2019re predisposed to be gruff and short, And less interested in making friends with their subordinates than seeing their orders followed.

BY SEAN FERRICK   the article says:\"Paramount Pictures revealed last week that a brand new Star Trek film is officially in production, And with a release date of June 9th, 2023 locked in, It's time to let the wild speculation begin. J. J. Abrams will be producing, Which leads one to believe that this film will be revisiting the Kelvin Timeline last seen in 2016's Star Trek Beyond. If that is indeed the case, What else could be in store for Chris Pine's Captain Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise's crew? There are many assumptions being made at present, Including that big one above (that Chris Pine is returning). That may not necessarily be the case, Though it does seem like the most likely outcome of the ongoing contract talks. Other appearances, Such as one by a certain God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth, Who played Kirk's father George in the 2009 reboot), Are far less certain, Though Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg are almost certainly safe-bets to appear. But what in particular should the next Star Trek film include? The Kelvin Timeline is divisive amongst the Trek faithful, But there are certain things the next film could do that would be sure to make it an intriguing prospect for fans new and old. . . \"  #4 listed in the article is   William Shatner, And it states \"William Shatner is alive and kicking, Having just celebrated his ninetieth birthday. Though his Captain Kirk is long dead in the Star Trek universe, Thanks to the inclusion of the Star Trek V promotional photo in Star Trek Beyond, We know that Shatner is the older version of Pine - if Zachary Quinto could come face to face with Leonard Nimoy, Might not the same be true of the two Kirks? To be blunt, William Shatner has not been the most outspoken fan of Star Trek, Yet he is an incredibly important part of the franchise and Star Trek's history. He has said in the past that he would be open to returning, Though the fact that he was dead in the franchise would have to be addressed. Were he to appear as an older version of Chris Pine's Kirk, That simple fact can be ignored. If this film does become a Time Travel tale, Having a cathartic moment between the two men would be the ultimate fan service and could very well end up serving as a coda to the Original Era of Star Trek. \""}, {"title": "The Captain's Quarters, Ranked, Continued", "body": "The Startrek.

Perhaps it is this extended time at home that caused me to pay closer attention to the homes of Star Trek captains. (It could also be that I recently watched three full seasons of Property Brothers too \u2014 it\u2019s been a long few months. ) I started to think about what qualities would make for the best living space aboard a starship. Three things stood out to me as the most important: the flow of the room, The amenities present, And the comfort of the space in space! Within each of these categories I thought about what elements I thought were essential and adjusted my rating based on their presence or absence. I\u2019ve ranked each room out of ten in each of the three main categories and then added these to give an overall score out of thirty. Captain Kirk\u2019s Quarters - USS Enterprise (NCC - 1701) StarTrek. ComFlow: 7/10While small, The flow of Kirk\u2019s room is better than your average college dorm room. There are two distinct spaces in the room (office area and sleeping area) which are made clear by the furniture and the small dividing wall. It is this partial wall that makes this space more like a small apartment and less like a dorm room. The entrance into the room is in the office area which lends additional privacy to the sleeping area. While a sliding door between the two rooms would have provided more privacy the room flows well for its size. Amenities: 5/10Kirk\u2019s quarters have most of what a Starfleet officer needs. There is a computer, Communication system, Desk, Chairs, Built in drawers, And a closet/bathroom. The main drawback for me was the lack of access to food in the quarters. If I was Captain of a starship I know I would want to be able to have a midnight snack without leaving my room. Comfort:   3/10The comfort of Captain Kirk\u2019s quarters gets a low rating for a few reasons. The first is the complete lack of windows \u2014 even tiny college dorm rooms have one window! The second is the bed. Kirk\u2019s bed appears to be only marginally more comfortable than the beds in sickbay \u2014 at least in sickbay you get a blanket. And what is with that weird rectangular pillow? Also, Orange is not the calming color you would expect in your bedroom.

The Star Trek franchise is expanding on Paramount+ with several new shows and continuing series. The parody sketch takes the form of a Paramount+ Star Trek prequel titled Starcharter Andromeda. It sees the crew of a starship in typical Starfleet crisis mode until they're interrupted by two younger officers played by episode host Carey Mulligan and series regular Mikey Day. The rest of the crew characterizes them as rich white kids from an expensive Starfleet academy used to having the world revolve around them. You can watch the sketch below. This bit is hardly SNL's first time basing a segment on Star Trek. The live comedy show's relationship with the sci-fi franchises dates back to SNL's first season when John Belushi impersonated Captain Kirk in the sketch titled \"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise. \" Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner, Would host the show in 1986 and participate in the notorious \"get a life\" sketch that almost sullied his relationship with Star Trek fans.

The planet of Deneva has been overtaken by creatures that have been controlling the inhabitants and causing extreme pain and madness.

Kirk asks his nephew if he\u2019s sure he doesn\u2019t want to go back to Earth to live with his grandmother. Peter responds by saying that his father thought Deneva was the best place in the whole galaxy.

Kirk says he hopes not because if they hadn\u2019t been able to find a resolution to the problem of the creatures on the planet, He would have had to destroy Deneva. He doesn\u2019t want his nephew to ever have to make that kind of choice. According to the novel Sarek by A. C.

In   \u201cTomorrow is Yesterday\u201d (which preceded \u201cCity\u201d in Season 1 of TOS) Kirk and Sulu don\u2019t really stick around in the \u201860s long enough to have to change clothes. In \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever\u201d not only do Kirk and Spock change clothes, But they also get jobs. One of the coolest images from this episode is the moment where Bones and Spock narrowly miss each other, And we see Spock, Diligently, And kindly, Serving soup. It\u2019s a moment where the realism of Kirk and Spock squatting in the past actually sets in. By Season 2, TOS would have its Trekpunk routine perfected into a schtick. But, Spock\u2019s bucket hat in \u201cAssignment: Earth\u201d   is no match for his beanie in \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever. \u201dAs a subgenre within Star Trek, Trekpunk is unique because unlike the holodeck-gone-amok historical story (like \u201cA Fistful of Datas\u201d) a true Trekpunk story \u2014 like DS9\u2019s \u201cLittle Green Men\u201d \u2014 makes the stakes more about the people and less about the technology. Because we\u2019re so used to Sisko or Kirk calling their ship and getting beamed away, The Trekpunk storyline not only takes away the communicators, It takes away Starfleet itself. One of Star Trek\u2019s most profound ideas is the notion of the egalitarian Federation. But, In a Trekpunk storyline, Spock, Or Sisko or Janeway have to figure out what those values look like before society wises up. In \u201cPast Tense, \u201d the spiritual successor to \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever, \u201d Sisko straight-up creates the future by becoming the historical figure we needed in the past.  In The Voyage Home, Bones says \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle these people got out of the 20th century. \u201d It\u2019s a joke. We laugh, But we also laugh bitterly, Because we\u2019re still worried about getting out of the 21st Century. We love seeing our favorite fictional people try to fit in. But, The power comes from what anachronism represents. Spock in a beanie or Sisko in a trench coat isn\u2019t just about Trek characters looking awesome. It\u2019s about the idea that Trek characters could literally visit us, And meet us on our terms. If Spock and Kirk were dressed like us, What would we have to say to them? Could we live up to what they represent? Trekpunk brings the sartorial vibe of the Final Frontier down to Earth. But, In doing so these kinds of stories, Lift us up. What the visual aesthetic of \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever\u201d proved was simple. Not all optimism looks the same. Sometimes the hopeful future wears spandex. Sometimes, It wears flannel. \""}, {"title": "The Birth of Trekpunk   continued", "body": "The article continues But, What I\u2019m proposing is that Trekpunk is a bigger mood than just TNG briefly going steampunk. Trekpunk is that moment when in \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever, \u201d when Spock makes Kirk go grocery shopping to buy him some 1930s knickknacks in order to reboot his 23rd-century tech, Using what Spock calls is equipment that \u201cisn\u2019t very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. \u201d It\u2019s a good joke and sort of Spock\u2019s inverted version of the famous Arthur C. Clarke axiom, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. \u201d In Spock\u2019s corollary, Is that any tech that predates the microchip is basically barbaric. It\u2019s a good joke, But what makes the Trekpunk trope so fun is that our Trek heroes have to work with what they have, While occasionally dazzling an unsophisticated time period with a little future-world know-how. In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Spock trades his beanie for a DIY headband, And Bones complains that the 1986 hospital is like \u201cthe Dark Ages. \u201d In the Star Trek: Voyager episode, \u201cFuture\u2019s End, \u201d the crew attempts to infiltrate Los Angeles circa 1996, And Tom Paris gives Tuvok grief for not taking his shirt off on the beach. And in First Contact, Troi\u2019s unfamiliarity with \u201csomething called tequila\u201d leads her to \u201cblending in\u201d with the human population of the mid 21st century. In all of these examples, Time travel serves as a classic fish-out-of-water story, Which, As most people know, Is comedy gold. Half of Back to the Future\u2019s jokes rely on the audience knowing something the time traveler doesn\u2019t, And when Trekpunk succeeds, It does the same thing. \u201cWhat does it mean, \u2018exact change\u2019? \u201d Spock bemoans after he and Kirk are kicked off of a city bus. But, What makes Trekpunk explicitly different from other time travel humor, Is that we, The audience, Are equally familiar with the retro-time period as we are with the future-tense of the Trek time travelers. The novelty is, In part, Seeing our favorite Starfleet characters in clothes that make them look a little more like us.

BY RYAN BRITTAPRIL 6, 2021     the article says:   Harlan Ellison\u2019s \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever\u201d is a correctly beloved episode of the classic Star Trek. It\u2019s a bleak story about what can happen when time travel goes wrong, And why the history of the world often moves in cruel and mysterious ways. The story isn\u2019t abstract though, Because it puts Captain Kirk\u2019s heart on the line, And in doing so, Gives us one of the greatest performances of William Shatner\u2019s entire career. It\u2019s a memorable, And tragic science fiction love story, Full of pain and optimism in equal measure. It\u2019s also got Spock rocking a beanie. While the philosophical nuances and various differences between Ellison's script and Roddenbery\u2019s have been debated ad infinitum, The impact of Spock\u2019s beanie and Kirk\u2019s flannel shirt has been tragically overlooked. What we talk about when we talk about \u201cCity on the Edge of Forever, \u201d isn\u2019t just that it was a great episode, But instead, That it gave birth to an aesthetic subgenre within Star Trek. Up until now, That subgenre has never had a name, Perhaps, Because it\u2019s never been fully identified. But like any subgenre, You know it when you see it. Kirk and Spock rocking their 1930\u2019s outfits, While trying to reverse-engineer Spock\u2019s tricorder, Was the birth of a recurring motif I like to call: Trekpunk. What is Trekpunk? Well, You\u2019ve heard of steampunk, Right? Spun out of the word \u201ccyberpunk, \u201d steampunk is basically a fictional setting or aesthetic that embraces Victorian (or Edwardian? ) anachronisms through science fiction. In some senses, This means there are a few borderline examples of steampunk within Star Trek itself, Like, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow, \u201d for example, Which features the TNG crew undercover in 1893, Trying to stop aliens in San Francisco, With a little help from Mark Twain. Basically, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow\u201d was the TNG forerunner to something like Penny Dreadful. Really! Imagine if the crew had been stuck in Earth\u2019s past forever? They would have totally become steampunk defenders of Earth. \""}, {"title": "To the Moon Alice, Continued", "body": "The article continues :\"What happened was, Elon Musk, Who owns SpaceX, Decided there\u2019s no reason only governments should have a corner on the space travel market.

As Milton Freedman once said, \u2018If you put the U. S. Government in charge of the Sahara Desert, In five years there would be a shortage of sand. \u2019So SpaceX has been building rockets and stuff, And blasting them off into space for a long time now. The goal has always been to eventually send people up there, And since Musk is primarily a businessman, He plans to make a buck or two in the process by selling tickets for space flights, Pretty much just like the airlines do now, Except without the annoying hassle of being groped by a TSA employee. SpaceX has built a \u2018Starship, \u2019 with room for ten or twelve people, Capable of week-long trips into deep space. Or at least shallow space. Basically, Around the moon and back.

For all of the dangers and threats the Enterprise crew face, From physical to emotional, They always overcome them together.

Much as I hate to parallel the Pharaoh, The villain of the Passover story, With Spock, A hero and a pacifist, They are both powerful men brought low (and emotional) by blood. 2. Frogs - \"And the Children Shall Lead\" Star Trek: The Original Series - \"And the Children Shall Lead\"\"And the Children Shall Lead\"StarTrek. ComThere is a debate in Judaism over whether the second plague was a swarm of frogs, Or one giant frog that covered the land of Egypt. But if we go with the more traditional interpretation of a swarm, Then the Star Trek equivalent swarm would be the children from \"And the Children Shall Lead\" who take over the Enterprise. Not only are they a hive mind (very swarm-like behavior) controlled by an evil embodiment called Gorgon, But they also bring the majority of the bridge crew under their sway. Whichever frog interpretation you go with, Kirk was as deeply unhappy with this plague-parallel as the Egyptians were with their own froggy problem \u2014 and he was pretty hostile to the kids too!"}, {"title": "From Entertainment Weekly, Shatner says", "body": "From the Entertainment Weekly website ew.

And he had some serious dramatic ideas in mind for the characters, With one being bringing Dr. Leonard McCoy\u2019s daughter, Joanna, On board the Enterprise as a regular character. And being that she would have been beautiful, Kirk would have been attracted to her, And the two would have possibly become romantically involved with her. Roddenberry wanted to give Bones the chance to grow more as a main character and test the limits of his friendship with Captain Kirk. Being that Bones and his daughter were estranged, The doctor would have had to work on his relationship with her while dealing with the potential relationship his commanding officer would have with her as well. That would have made for some seriously dramatic episodes. Captain Kirk didn\u2019t have long-term relationships so imagine if he\u2019d gotten involved with Joanna only for the relationship to end shortly thereafter. It would had to have affected his friendship with Dr. McCoy. Even if the relationship had gone on for several episodes, Bones wouldn\u2019t have been too happy with it, Considering he knew Kirk\u2019s track record with women. Bones would have wrestled with his desire to protect his daughter who possibly didn\u2019t want to be protected, Especially not from a father she barely knew. And all the while, He would still answer to Captain Kirk. This could have made for some really emotionally-charged episodes, And it sounds like Roddenberry had intended to take the show in a slightly different direction, Possibly even having Kirk settle down a bit.

For his 90th birthday, The man that became Captain Kirk in TV\u2019s Star Trek is boldly going where no other Star Trek captain has gone before: he\u2019s becoming a digital memory for you to eventually talk to. It\u2019s a concept available in an app called \u201cStoryFile\u201d, That aims to capture recordings of people and connect it with artificial intelligence for you to talk to. The idea behind StoryFile is a little more complicated than that, With recorded conversations connecting with AI and a voice chat system to let you talk with digital versions of real people. Already, The technology is available on iOS in something of a test state, With an app allowing you to ask questions to Nobel Prize winning scientist Eric Kandel and ISS Astronaut Terry Virts, An astronaut that has also weighed in on another recent tech concept, The Vaonis Vespera digital telescope. However StoryFile is a little different. Rather than look to the stars, The concept means a collection of conversations are linked together, With a microphone button allowing you to talk to the people inside the frame. You can ask them questions like you normally would, And even offer simple greetings \u2014 hey, How are you? \u2014 but most of the questions are typically going to centre about things they know about. With Eric Kandel, You can ask \u201cis it hard to be a scientist? \u201d, And you\u2019ll hear something that may answer the question, But also will likely delve into Kandel\u2019s history. Ask Terry Virts about the fear factor of space \u2014 \u201cis it scary to go into space\u201d \u2014 and you\u2019ll hear about what can drive fear when you\u2019re up there, And what astronauts do. Ask Larry Bacow, President of Harvard University \u201chow hard is it to get into Harvard? \u201d, And you\u2019ll get an answer that says the university is looking for people who are creative and take initiative, Among other things. The point of all of this is to provide some lasting memory and a way to talk to these people digitally, Either now or when they go, Though it can come across as very sci-fi, As if it emerged from Black Mirror or I, Robot. For William Shatner, It means he\u2019ll essentially be able to talk to fans, Family, And friends in a digital way, Allowing anyone who\u2019s never had the opportunity to hear from the man who is and was Captain Kirk (before Chris Pine, Anyway). \u201cThis is for all my children and all my children\u2019s children and all my children\u2019s loved ones and all the loved ones of the loved ones, \u201d said William Shatner. \u201cThat\u2019s my gift to you down through time. \u201d"}, {"title": "From Ign   on May 8, 2009", "body": ".

The captain proved as unafraid to acknowledge his own failings as he was to challenge evils he encountered across the galaxy.

Saying goodbye to a hero viewers enjoy is a gut punch to fans that have come to love and identify with the character. When someone as beloved as Star Trek\u2019s Captain James Tiberius Kirk dies, The void it leaves can feel bigger than the emptiness of space. After 1994\u2019s Star Trek Generations, It\u2019s something many fans and the man behind the uniform seem to agree on.

Space is beautiful but also full of dangers, Hostile alien species, And other threats. At least that's the truth in the world of Star Trek. Its heroes explore strange places, Boldly go where no-one has gone before. Sometimes, Their missions go peacefully, But more often than not, Something goes wrong and the crew has to fight. As a result, Serving in Starfleet, Let alone on a spaceship, Isn't for the faint of heart. This job requires a lot of courage, Intelligence, And ideally also a certain level of physical fitness. That means a lot of Star Trek heroes would do well in the Hunger Games - but there can only be one winner! 7James T.

As Locutus, PIcard helped destroy a large number of Starfleet ships which resulted in approximately 11, 000 deaths or assimilations. And while it wasn\u2019t his choice, The knowledge Picard had acquired as a captain was used against him when he was captured and that knowledge remained a part of the Borg after Picard was returned to the Enterprise. Some fans think that after such an intrusive capture Picard should have been retired from Starfleet service or, At the very least, Have been stripped of his command. It wasn\u2019t that he himself had done anything wrong, But the assimilation itself was horrible and traumatic, And, As we saw in other episodes and First Contact, It left deep psychological scars. In addition, The families who lost loved ones would have had a difficult time seeing him as anything other than the enemy. It\u2019s understandable that fans would wonder how much of the Borg is left in Picard. Did they still have as strong a connection to him as they did Seven of Nine when she was removed from the collective? Were they still able to contact him? Shouldn\u2019t this have been something Starfleet was concerned about? If not when he was assimilated, Certainly after they learned more about Seven of Nine when she was still aboard Voyager. Starfleet had no way of knowing Picard\u2019s connection to the Borg was fully terminated, And they would have had reason to be concerned. So it\u2019s reasonable to ask how Jean-Luc Picard was promoted to Admiral when Starfleet didn\u2019t know if he could still be controlled by the Borg. And even though the events of Voyager\u2019s finale certainly dealt a crushing blow to the collective, The Borg aren\u2019t down and out completely, Especially if the Artifact established communications with the collective. While I understand why Starfleet wouldn\u2019t want to lose a captain like Picard, I also understand the other side of the coin as well. So what do you think? Should he have been promoted? \"   Plus early in the Movie Star Trek: First Contact  Picard says to Riker regarding why they are being ordered to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone and not fight the Borg     Picard says:\"Let's just say that Starfleet has every confidence in the Enterprise and her crew. They're just not sure about her Captain. They believe that a man who was once captured and assimilated by the Borg should not be put in a situation where he would face them again.

The Pop culture multiverse is incomplete without its fair share of face-offs. Because there are always two kinds of people and they would always favour one over another. Nobody admires two contenders equally; there is always a favourite. For example, The classic debate about the superiority of Beatles and Elvis divided the fans around the world. Similarly, We have had discussions over Batman vs Superman, American Office vs British Office, Coke vs Pepsi, Arnold Schwarzenegger vs Sylvester Stallone, George RR Martin vs JRR. Tolkien, And so on. In a similar vein, There has been a great divide between the supremacy of the two greatest Star Trek Captains, Captain James T. Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard from the Original Series and the Next-generation respectively. James T. Kirk: The young and adrenalin driven man becomes a Starship captain at a mere age of 32. He is flamboyant, Flirtatious and adventurous. He seemingly enjoys becoming a witness to the constant bantering between Spock and Bones. You would also find him giving Scotty a heart attack while increasing the warp speed at the maximum and playing with the Ship\u2019s capabilities. William Shatner played Kirk to perfection from the very start from 1966, And became a darling of the fans. His portrayal of Kirk knows how to love, Rebel and also stand up for his team. Over the years, Kirk is promoted as admiral, And he becomes a more sublime version of himself when he offers advice to the younger cadets. Jean-Luc Picard: Patrick Stewart plays Captain Picard who has served in the Starfleet for 40 years before commanding an enterprise ship to explore new worlds. Naturally, He is a thinking man\u2019s captain and has a reputation before becoming a captain. Being level headed and matured in his outlook, Picard comes across as a reliable choice for fans. His Shakespearean wisdom and a way of dealing with problems are sensible, Which is why many people prefer him over Kirk. Star-Trek creator Gene Roddenberry admitted that Picard was born out of his experience and Kirk was a reflection of his youth. So there will always be the intergalactic warabout who wins as a Captain. There is nothing judgmental about your choice as long as you could defend it with your wits. A quote by Uma Thurman from a deleted scene in Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction roughly sums up the need to have an entire debate about the topic. She says \u201cWhen it comes to important subjects, There are only two ways a person can answer\u2026 Somewhere, You have to make a choice.

Instead of a principled, Active leader whose hero was Abraham Lincoln and whose entire life was dedicated to service, The new Kirk is a childish, Selfish adventure-junkie. Where the original Kirk made bold choices and went with his instincts in an attempt to better the universe, The reboot Kirk jumps unthinking into situations because of his emotions. Where the original Kirk changed the Kobayashi Maru in order to give himself a fighting chance, The reboot Kirk changed it to make it easy to win. At the end of Star Trek Into Darkness the crew begins their five year mission from the TV show.

That was Kirk being Kirk, And it wasn\u2019t cheating. It\u2019s important to understand how Kirk approached the test - he thought it was fundamentally unfair. To Kirk the Kobayashi Maru itself was cheating. He believed the idea of an unwinnable scenario to be ludicrous; as he saw the world, Any problem could be overcome eventually with smarts and hard work. The equivalent here was being given a math test with the problem \u201c2+2=? \u201d and being told that \"4\" was the wrong answer. The test was the problem, And Kirk solved that problem. It\u2019s never explicitly stated what Kirk changed when he hacked the program (in a Star Trek novel it\u2019s said that Kirk reprogrammed the Klingons to have a respectful fear of \u201cThe\u201d Captain Kirk), But the gist of what we\u2019re to understand is that Kirk didn\u2019t hack the Kobayashi Maru to win, But rather to make it winnable. When Saavik accuses Kirk of cheating, He replies \u201cI changed the conditions of the test! \u201dThat\u2019s key. Cheating is creating an unfair advantage, Which Kirk would argue was the entire basis of the test. By changing the conditions - by evening out the odds - Kirk actually made the whole thing more fair, The opposite of cheating. Tell that to Orci and Kurtzman, Who have Kirk clearly cheat in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. He sits in his captain\u2019s chair, Munching an apple like an asshole, While the enemy ships' shields suddenly drop for no reason at all. His hack was not to even the playing field but rather to give himself an unfair advantage, To have the Klingons be unable to defend themselves. The reboot Kirk has the victory simply handed to him. It\u2019s hard not to side with Spock in this version of events. There\u2019s an argument to be made that the reboot Kirk dealt with the Kobayashi Maru very differently from the original timeline Kirk. If that were the case, The difference between the two Kirks would be so vast, They would be so unlike one another, That they would qualify as two completely different characters. We can bend over backwards to explain away character inconsistencies like that using nature vs nurture debates, But the truth is that it all boils down to filmmakers who have no actual understanding of the characters they\u2019re using. \""}, {"title": "Kirk did Not Cheat on the Kobayashi Maru test in The Wrath of Khan", "body": "The   website birthmoviesdeath.

Kirk Did Not Cheat On The Kobayashi Maru Test\"By DEVIN FARACIApr. 28, 2013   the article says:\"The opening of the new Star Trek video game sees Kirk and Spock playing three-dimensional chess when they are called to the bridge. The duo leave, But then Kirk walks back into frame and rearranges the pieces on the board to give him an advantage. This is the James T. Kirk of the rebooted Star Trek - a degenerate cheater, A guy against whom playing games would be absolutely no fun at all. The game was written in conjunction with Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, The same guys who wrote the 2009 reboot. I don\u2019t know if they wrote that exact scene, But it completely falls in line with their painfully inaccurate interpretation of James Kirk and his approach to the Kobayashi Maru test, Where they had Kirk straight up cheating. Here\u2019s the thing: Kirk didn\u2019t cheat on the Kobayashi Maru. The Kobayashi Maru was introduced in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. It\u2019s a Starfleet Academy simulator that is impossible to beat; the intended purpose of the test is to see how a potential captain deals with defeat and death. In the entire history of Starfleet only one cadet has ever actually bested the unbeatable test, And it was a young James Kirk. For much of Wrath of Khan the answer to how he did it remains a mystery, But eventually, When things seem darkest for the crew of the USS Enterprise, It\u2019s revealed: Kirk changed the program. It\u2019s easy to see why someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with James Kirk would think he cheated. Kirk has been known to bluff and bend the truth, Such as when he invented the card game fizzbin to confuse gangsters in A Piece of the Action, Or the time he killed a computer by lying to it in I, Mudd. And of course in Wrath of Khan he outmaneuvers his foe by broadcasting bad information and suckering Khan into getting his ship\u2019s console hacked. Looking at these, And other slightly unorthodox, Approaches to problem-solving in Kirk\u2019s history I understand why someone might jump to the conclusion that Kirk is a cheater and a rule breaker. But he\u2019s not. As a Starfleet captain on a deep space exploration mission he\u2019s often required to make hard decisions when faced with situations more nuanced than allowed for by regulations. And when his best friend died he did steal a starship and disable another ship, But that was an extreme action. That wasn\u2019t Kirk being Kirk.

For Trek I wanted to have the classic crew meet and interact with the modern era crew. I went in and took footage from over a dozen different films and movies from the Star Trek universe. I rotoscoped the classic crew into my film so they could finally share the stage with their younger counterparts. Interestingly enough Chris Pine is the exact same age as Willam Shatner was when he did his first season on Star Trek. I wanted to blend the crews together and have them get into a massive space battle together.

Star Trek V: The Phantom Menace: I haven't the video-editing prowess to actually make such a mashup, But it seems to me that taking the worst (by far) of the Star Trek films and one of the two worst Star Wars films (I'm never quite sure if Episode I or Episode II is worse, But since Episode I has more Jar Jar, I'm giving it the nod) would work really well. In any case, I think the mashup should be a story in which Spock's long-lost half brother Jar Jar hijacks the Enterprise to Coruscant in order to ask Starfleet Command for permission for young Anakin (who turns out to be a long-lost love child of Kirk's) to go to Starfleet Academy. \""}, {"title": "7 Star Trek/Star Wars Mashup ideas", "body": "From the wired.

Earlier today, President Obama (presumably) accidentally mixed up his science-fiction metaphors when speaking about the upcoming sequestration, Implying that he wasn't able to perform a \"Jedi mind meld. \" As most readers of GeekDad will immediately recognize, That's a combination of the term \"Jedi\" from Star Wars and \"mind meld\" from Star Trek.

Here are seven ideas, In no particular order (Note: I've stuck with Star Trek: The Original Series references here, Since they're what would be most likely seen in new films from Abrams):1. RedTrooper: A mashup of a Redshirt (ST) and a Stormtrooper (SW). It's been widely discussed what would happen if a Redshirt and a Stormtrooper fought each other, But what if the two were combined? Surely the result would look like a Stormtrooper wearing a red Starfleet uniform shirt, And would repeatedly shoot at himself, And miss. 2. Triwok: A mashup of a Tribble (ST) and an Ewok (SW). The result would likely be exactly like the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, Only they would defeat the Imperial soldiers by reproducing so rapidly as to overwhelm and smother them. Assuming there's some decent quadrotriticale in the forests of Endor, Of course. 3. Chewkov: One of the best parallels between the two universes: Each has a starship navigator with. . . An extremely thick accent, Let's say. And both Chewbacca's (SW) and Chekov's (ST) names start with the same three letters. Coincidence, Or fate? Of course, Nien Nunb (SW) fits the bill here, Too, But his name is hard enough to pronounce on its own, Let alone mashed up with someone else's. \""}, {"title": "Kirk's Enterprise made out of Twizzlers", "body": "From Startrek.

Abrams\u2019 big-screen reboot managed to make the world of Kirk and Spock accessible to a mainstream blockbuster audience.

The Lens Flares WorkStar Trek Into Darkness - Lens FlareA common criticism of J. J. Abrams\u2019 movies is that he overuses the \u201clens flare\u201d effect. However, In Star Trek, It works. It doesn\u2019t work as much in something grounded, Like Super 8, Or something more focused on ancient legend than futuristic tech, Like Star Wars, But it works a charm in Star Trek. Since most of the scenes take place on starships filled with space-age gadgets and ultramodern weaponry, The lens flare adds to each sequence, Rather than detracting from it. The lens flare isn\u2019t a particularly innovative film-making technique, But Abrams\u2019 style does go hand-in-hand with the material in this instance. 4A Good Balance Of Heart And HumorSimon Pegg as Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in Star Trek (2009)A healthy balance of heart and humor \u2013 not too much of either, But plenty of both \u2013 is the key to a great blockbuster. It\u2019s fair to say that Marvel Studios currently has a stranglehold on the blockbuster market, And this is mainly because their movies are imbued with a delightful combination of heart and humor. J. J. Abrams\u2019 Star Trek reboot balances these two elements wonderfully, With characters who genuinely care about each other and a lot of funny gags (mostly involving Simon Pegg\u2019s Scotty). There\u2019s nothing worse than a humorless take on Star Trek. Humor has been there since the beginning. It\u2019s a relief that Abrams honored that amidst a gloomy cinematic climate. 3Perfect CastingSpock & Uhura in Star Trek (2009)The original actors from the Star Trek TV series \u2013 William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols etc. \u2013 were perfect for their roles. But the movies they were in went some way towards sullying their legacy, Because the pre-reboot Star Trek film franchise had breathtaking highs and soul-crushing lows. The reboot gave us the ideal casting for those characters. Chris Pine has the cool attitude and heroic bravado to play Kirk; Zachary Quinto has the calm demeanor and likability to play Spock; Zoe Saldana has the fierceness and nobility to play Uhura. All the reboot actors have been perfectly cast in their roles, Which makes the characters more relatable. 2The Incredible Chemistry Shared By Chris Pine And Zachary QuintoNot only are Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto perfect for the roles of Kirk and Spock, They also have the chemistry that made William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy\u2019s pairing in the roles such a delight. This chemistry grows and strengthens as the movie goes on, But that\u2019s only because the movie is a prequel. Kirk and Spock aren\u2019t friends yet when we first meet them. Instead of just seeing them as close allies, Which would be plenty, We see them as adversaries who grow to become close friends. We see how their relationship grew from the beginning. With lesser actors, This wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as effective. \""}, {"title": "10 Ways the 2009 Reboot made Star Trek better, Continued", "body": "The screenrant. Com article continues :8. A More Detailed Design Of The EnterpriseThe Star Trek TV series gave us an immersive view of the U. S. S. Enterprise. We got a sense of what all the different components looked like, From the main bridge to the engine room, And the appearance of the ship as a whole as it cruised through space was gorgeously rendered. However, It didn\u2019t have the budget or the technology to really plunge audiences into the Enterprise in the way that the reboot did. Thanks to CGI effects on all the windows and screens, We get more of a sense of the Enterprise as an actual starship making its way through the vacuum of space. We feel it cruising through space as opposed to just seeing it. 7It Made The Reboot Part Of The Original CanonNew Spock, Zachary Quinto, Meets Old Spock, Leonard Nimoy in 2009's Star Trek. J. J. Abrams defined the term \u201creboot\u201d with his 2009 Star Trek movie, But he also subverted the rules of rebooting by acknowledging the original canon. Rather than just retelling the story of The Original Series, The movie took place in an alternate reality where all of those characters look a little different. The alternate reality was created by time travel done by both Nero and the original Spock. This led to Leonard Nimoy\u2019s Spock making an appearance. If reboots, By their nature, Are nostalgic, Then Abrams found a way to reconcile looking into the future with nostalgically looking into the past in a way that he failed to do with his subsequent Star Wars reboot. 6Spectacular Action SequencesThe Nerada attacking the USS Kelvin in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. If there\u2019s one thing that the early Star Trek series struggled with, It\u2019s action sequences. This is mainly because the technology wasn\u2019t there to show starships blowing each other up and the stunt business hadn\u2019t been given the shot in the arm that led to visceral, Brutal fight scenes in movies. Even the most memorable action sequences from the TV series, Like Kirk\u2019s fight with a Gorn, Are laughable by today\u2019s standards. But J. J.

Abrams' reboot changed Star Trek for the better. BY BEN SHERLOCKPUBLISHED JUL 14, 2019     the article says:\"It\u2019s easy to write off J. J. Abrams as a one-trick pony based on the fact that his Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens, Was a rehash of A New Hope and had little of its own merits to offer. But back in 2009, He proved himself to be a great director \u2013 and a great rebooter of beloved franchises \u2013 with his Star Trek movie. Abrams himself has admitted that he wasn\u2019t a huge Trek fan when he took on the job, But this distance from the source material might be the key to what made his reboot so great. Here are ten ways Abram's movie improved the franchise. 10The Reboot Gives The Characters A More Complex BackstoryStar Trek Starfleet HQPrequels are always tricky, Because the audience already knows the ending. But J. J. Abrams \u2013 and his screenwriting team, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, Whose contributions shouldn\u2019t be discounted \u2013 used the prequel framework to explore the characters\u2019 backstories a lot more than the TV series ever did. We see what happened to Kirk\u2019s father, How Kirk and Spock met, What their time at Starfleet Academy was like, How Kirk ended up captaining the U. S. S. Enterprise, And what brought the crew together in the first place. The characters of Star Trek had never been given a background that complex before and it was immensely satisfying. 9A Consistent ToneKirk Spock 2009 - Complete Guide to Star TrekThe tone of Star Trek is very specific, And as soon as The Dark Knight hit theaters, The tone of every single franchise shifted towards the one set by Christopher Nolan for the Batman character. But the problem with that is that the tone of The Dark Knight only suits Batman and the Joker and Gotham City. It doesn\u2019t work for Superman or the Fantastic Four or most of the other intellectual properties that were given a Nolan-ish makeover after The Dark Knight grossed over $1 billion. However, The bright, Optimistic tone of J. J. Abrams\u2019 Star Trek reboot is in direct contrast with The Dark Knight \u2013 and it\u2019s perfect for Star Trek. \""}, {"title": "Best Unused ideas from Star Trek Movies", "body": "Screenrant.

While some of the talk may be wishful thinking among fans, Who would like to see Kirk return to the slate of Trek shows. It\u2019s only fair since they brought back Picard and Janeway (in Star Trek: Prodigy); why not bring back the baddest of them all? Thanks to a Discovery tie-in novel called Die Standing, Kirk is mentioned a few times because Philippa Georgiou served with Starfleet personnel who worked with Kirk on the U. S. S. Farragut. After an accident on the ship, Kirk was sent back to Earth to recover. In theory, Kirk could serve with other Starfleet members who may be stationed aboard the Enterprise. Could Pike, Spock, And Number One cross paths with a Lieutenant Kirk? Or, We might get to visit Kirk during his haughty days at Starfleet Academy, Which was also another idea that people have been talking about for some time. Fans got to see Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru test in Star Trek (2009), But there could be so much more fun for a young Kirk to have in San Francisco. This might fit into an expanded Star Trek Universe, One that ViaccomCBS CEO Bob Bakish has been promising for some time. We also got a glimpse of that with all of the social media leaks and announcements of what shows we may get to see in 2021, Including Season 4 of Discovery, The first season of Prodigy, And Season 2 of both Picard and Lower Decks.

Thanks to a recent interview with Trek chief Alex Kurtzman and Head of Programming for CBS Julie McNamara with Variety, We know there might be even less. McNamara said that fans will not see a new Star Trek title until a current show finishes its run.

In the Star Trek Universe. Some may say that it\u2019s Spock, But that\u2019s just not true. Our pointy-eared friend has been rebooted and recast a bunch of times. Not so with Captain Kirk. We\u2019ve seen only a few (controversial) times where other actors have strode in his mighty steps. So the fact that there are persistent rumors of a new actor to play Kirk on the Paramount+ makes complete sense. To be clear, This is not about William Shatner returning to the role he made iconic over three seasons of The Original Series, Two seasons of The Animated Series, And seven feature films. Understandably, Many have a hard time separating Kirk from Shatner, Even though the actor has stated several times that he\u2019s done with the role, Only to reverse himself and say that he\u2019d be willing to return under the right circumstances. There was a time when he even thought he would return in some way for Star Trek: Beyond, But things never came together, And he wasn\u2019t included in the film. Sadly, Shatner was Kirk on the bridge of the Enterprise for so many years, Only to be killed by a bridge in Star Trek: Generations. Irony is cruel, Even in Star Trek. And this is also not about a fourth Kelvin movie, Which would star Chris Pine as Kirk. When the \u201cKelvin Kirk\u201d met the original for the documentary film The Captains, Shatner declared that looking at Pine was like looking at himself \u201c50 years ago. \u201d"}, {"title": "About the Legendary Nature of Kirk & Crew in The Search for Spock, Part 3", "body": "The article lastly says:\"In the era of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Another first-officer of the Starship Enterprise \u2014 Jonathan Frakes \u2014   made the leap from actor to Star Trek director. Of course, Frakes is famous to Star Trek fans as William T. Riker, But after he directed the TNG episode, \u201cThe Offspring\u201d in 1990, Like Leonard Nimoy, He changed the way The Next Generation was made. This culminated in Frakes directing fan and critical favorite Star Trek: First Contact in 1996. Other actors from The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, And Voyager all directed episodes, Including Avery Brooks, Rene Auberjonois, LeVar Burton, Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Alexander Siddig, Gates McFadden, Robert Duncan McNeil, Roxann Dawson, Andrew Robinson, Tim Russ, And Robert Picardo. Had Leonard Nimoy not directed The Search For Spock would this have happened? Jonathan Frakes clearly kicked open the door for actors directing episodes of the Star Trek spin offs, But it\u2019s hard to imagine this idea being accepted by Rick Berman back in 1990 had Nimoy not done something similar in 1984. In some ways, By Nimoy becoming the director of a Star Trek film in the \u201880s, He created a context through which the literal next generation of Star Trek actors were able to do what he and Shatner wanted to do in the \u201860s. To this day, Jonathan Frakes continues to be a strong directorial presence on Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard. Famed composer Michael Giacchino even directed the animated Short Treks episode, \u201cEphraim and DOT. \u201d Could we see a future where one of the Discovery actors directs an episode? Could Rebecca Romijn direct an episode of Strange New Worlds? Assuming any of these actors wanted to, It seems possible that they could, Thanks to the bravery, Intelligence, And kindness of Leonard Nimoy. The Search For Spock wasn\u2019t an egotistical project. Spock might be in the title, And Nimoy its director, But this was the first Star Trek story that allowed the rest of the ensemble to each shine in their own unique ways. It's a generous film. Generous to both the characters and to the fans. It's a unifying story that could only have been guided by someone who was part of the family. In becoming the director of The Search For Spock, Nimoy gave the Star Trek franchise a huge gift. The universe might be expanding in real life, But by bringing the Trek family in for a huge hug in The Search For Spock, Nimoy made the famous outer space family closer. The proof is clearly in the last shot of the movie. As Spock recalls the name of his closest friend \u2014 \u201cJim, Your name, Is Jim, \u201d the rest of the cast surrounds him. Nimoy made a bold choice with The Search For Spock. He suggested the franchise might not only be about aliens and exploration, But instead, About family. He was right. \""}, {"title": "About the Legendary Nature of Kirk & Crew in The Search for Spock- Continued", "body": "The article continues :\"That challenge turned out to be directing his first major feature film, Star Trek III: The Search For Spock. This was a major turning point for the Star Trek family, Mostly because by having one of the actors behind the camera, The way Trek was crafted became more blended. Star Trek has always benefitted from an infusion of outside talent to create some of its most thrilling and memorable moments \u2014 Nicholas Meyer directing The Wrath of Khan and Morgan Gendel writing \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d spring to mind. But, As a balancing force, Sometimes, Star Trek kept things in the family, And became, Arguably, More emotionally potent because of it. Star Trek III: The Search For Spock is seldom listed as the greatest Trek film of all time, But it was the first of the TOS movies that treated the entire cast of characters as an ensemble. The Motion Picture wasn\u2019t really about the whole cast. The Wrath of Khan certainly wasn\u2019t. But The Search For Spock highlighted each and every character\u2019s abilities in the heroic quest to snag the Enterprise and retrieve Spock\u2019s body from the Genesis Planet. This, As it turns out, Was a specific goal of Leonard Nimoy. As he crafted the story with Harve Bennett, Nimoy was inspired to make sure everyone in the cast got a fair shake. But his inspiration to do this came from a surprising source: Mission: Impossible. \u201cIn part, I think I was influenced by my experience on Mission: Impossible, Where each character had a specific job to complete in any given adventure, \u201d Nimoy revealed in I Am Spock. \u201cWe worked, Very consciously, To define special moments for each of the Enterprise bridge crew. \u201d From 1969 to 1971, Nimoy played a master-of-disguise named the Great Paris on Mission: Impossible. This kind of super-team approach clearly influences the crew of the Enterprise in their mission to   break Bones out of jail, Hijack the Enterprise, And, Eventually, Pick-up Spock\u2019s body from the Genesis Planet and bring it back to Vulcan. When you consider how close-knit the crew feels in this movie, It\u2019s sort of impossible to imagine the movie not being directed by Nimoy. At that time, He was keenly aware of what the fans wanted, And also, What they expected from the characters. The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan are each wonderful pieces of art, But they may not have presented the crew as the family that the fans remembered. After The Search For Spock, That approach became the norm. In it of itself, This third film extended the cinematic reach of Star Trek in ways fans had previously only dreamed of. It paved the way for Nimoy to direct the next sequel, The beloved Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. And, It set a precedent that allowed William Shatner to direct one of my favorite Trek films, The Final Frontier. This led to a Star Trek tradition that redefined the franchise. \""}, {"title": "About the Legendary nature of Kirk & Crew in   \nThe Search for Spock", "body": "Startrek.

Among the likely candidates, The moment when Leonard Nimoy took over directorial duties for Star Trek III: The Search For Spock tends to be overlooked. One June 1, 1984, The Search For Spock was released, Becoming the very first Trek production crafted by one of the actors. And the way Star Trek was created behind-the-scenes would never be the same. The confident energy behind-the-scenes of the Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan meant that the pre-production conversations for a sequel were happening well before that film was released. Before The Wrath of Khan began filming, The idea of a series of Star Trek films wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion, But as it got going, The sequel seemed to be a lock. While Nicholas Meyer was still behind the camera, Producer Harve Bennett, In collaboration with Leonard Nimoy crafted the moment in The Wrath of Khan when Spock says \u201cRemember\u201d and briefly mind-melds with Bones.

But when he actually died on that away mission, Even the thought of wanting his best friend to die was too much for Jean-Luc. Subsequently, He cut the Crushers out of his life, A symbol of how lust and emotion can get in the way of duty. Until they show back up on the Enterprise. Though Picard is initially warm to Wesley upon seeing each other again, The series is quick to make the boy a punching bag for the crew--and the audience by proxy. Trekkers criticized the sizable number of storylines in TNG's first four seasons that saw Wesley getting himself and the crew in trouble, As well as serving as a \"Mary Sue\" at points with his natural engineering skills. His character was even at the central point of one of Star Trek's biggest memes, As a fed-up Picard responded to the boy's arguments that android Data is not who he says he is with a curt, \"Shut up, Wesley! \"But that attitude may also have root in Khouri's theory. \"This explains the visceral discomfort and even rage that Wesley\u2019s presence ignites when he\u2019s in Picard\u2019s presence, \" he writes. \"The boy, Clearly his son, Is a hellish reminder to Picard of his disgraceful failure as a friend and possibly criminal actions as commander. It\u2019s truly nightmarish. \"When viewing The Next Generation through this lens, The Picard-Wesley relationship takes on a whole new meaning. Their dynamic is not one of a man stepping into the role of mentor for an unguided youth, Out of guilt for what happened to his father. Rather, It's a man reconciling his past, Realizing that embracing his previous actions rather than running away from them allows him to become something he was always meant to be: A dad. \""}, {"title": "Theory about Wesley Crusher being Picard's son", "body": "From the website   cbr. Com   in late February 2021 an article is headlined \"Star Trek Theory: Picard Had A Secret Son - And People HATED Him\"A Star Trek: The Next Generation theory posits Captain Picard may have had a secret son aboard the Enterprise. BY MIKE BLOOM     the article says:\"Throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation, One of Jean-Luc Picard's defining traits was his general discomfort and iciness towards children. The lone exception seemed to be young Wesley Crusher, A prodigious engineer who went from Enterprise hanger-on to a Starfleet Academy cadet under Picard's tutelage. But the captain's interest in the boy may have a deeper meaning. DC Comics editor Andy Khouri posted a thread on Twitter outlining his TNG theory: Wesley is actually Picard's son. \"Wesley was clearly setup to be Picard\u2019s bastard, \" he writes, \"but they chickened out. \" He references events prior to the series, Specifically Wesley's relationship between his mother Beverly and father Jack. The two served as officers on the USS Stargazer under Captain Picard. Unfortunately, Jack lost his life while on an away mission with Picard, Leaving Wesley father-less at five years old. In the TNG pilot, Picard has a look of shock when he sees Beverly and Wesley become part of the Enterprise crew. Surprisingly, The captain then goes on to warmly show the young man the bridge, Which shocks his fellow officers. Khouri reasons that Picard's reaction is \"because of the crushing guilt Picard felt not just for betraying his best friend Jack Crusher by sleeping with his wife, But because, As Jack\u2019s commander, He then sent the man TO HIS DEATH. \"The Jean-Luc Picard we know from the Enterprise was certainly not someone to use the captaincy for ill intentions. But perhaps things were different back on the Stargazer. We've seen in previous episodes that the Battle of Maxia caused the new captain to abandon the Stargazer, Prompting him being court martialed. It's possible that, While still a bridge officer, He and Beverly had an affair behind Jack's back, Meaning Wesley is his biological child. \""}, {"title": "Shatner should be in the 4th Kelvin Timeline Film", "body": "Screenrant.

Kirk in an unconfirmed fourth film. BY DUSTY STOWE\"William Shatner denies a rumor that he'll return to the final frontier in the still unannounced fourth Star Trek film set in the Kelvin timeline. The most recent iteration of the Star Trek film franchise occurs in an alternate universe, Chronicling a young James Kirk (Chris Pine) and the USS Enterprise crew. The modern Star Trek film franchise got off to a strong start with 2009's appropriately titled Star Trek, Directed by J. J. Abrams. That movie made Chris Pine a star and managed to reboot the franchise for the 21st century and honor what came before. The 2013 sequel Star Trek Into Darkness was less well-received, And while 2016's Star Trek Beyond was greeted with warm reviews, It was a box office disappointment, Prompting Paramount to reassess the future of the franchise on the big screen. No fourth film in the Kelvin timeline has been announced, Though rumors have swirled that Paramount is keen to make another installment at some point. A recent rumor suggested the film is back on track and that the producers were eyeing Shatner's return in his iconic role as Kirk. Still, Shatner shot down those rumors on Twitter, Clarifying he has no involvement with the film. Check out Shatner's tweet below. Shatner last played Kirk on the big screen in 1994's Star Trek: Generations, Which saw the cast of Star Trek: The Original Series pass the baton to the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Captain Kirk died helping Captain Picard save a planet from a madman named Tolian Soran, Seemingly ending Shatner's time in the Star Trek franchise for good. There have been discussions over the years about bringing Shatner back as Kirk in some way, But it's never quite worked out. Shatner is almost 90 and seems to have entered a sort of semi-retirement, Where he primarily does voiceover work and commercials these days. It's to imagine a scenario where Shatner could credibly come back as Kirk, Even utilizing time travel shenanigans. Beyond that, There's still no confirmation that a fourth Star Trek film starring Pine and crew is in the cards. While the film wing of the franchise has mostly gone dormant, The television wing has blossomed considerably, With a bevy of new Star Trek series planned in addition to Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: Picard, And Star Trek: Lower Decks. If a fourth film happens, It likely won't be anytime soon and don't count on Shatner being around for the ride. \" Countless people want William Shatner to Return as Kirk in the  4th Film in the Kelvin Timeline, Or for Shatner to Return as Kirk in a Live Action Role in the Prime Timeline of the Star Trek Universe,"}, {"title": "New Novel with Kirk continued:", "body": "The article from   comicbook.

Over the course of his seven-decade-long career he has appeared in multiple sci-fi cornerstones, Including The Twilight Zone, TekWar, 3rd Rock from the Sun and, Most famously, The Star Trek franchise. His portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk captivated audiences across television and film for a long time, But it's been over 25 years since he last appeared on screen as captain of the USS Enterprise, And he hasn't sounded all that enthused about ever returning. However, The actor has revealed the only way that he would consider reprising his most famous role. In a recent interview with Inverse, William Shatner noted that he is not necessarily 100% against the idea of reprising the role of James T. Kirk, But the creative team involved would have to follow some pretty specific parameters in place for him to agree. In his words:If they wrote an interesting role and they could explain the 55-year difference I might consider it. But at the moment, I'm really busy and Star Trek is in my past. The Star Trek legend seemed to leave the door partially open for a Kirk-ian comeback, Mentioning that it\u2019s not out of the question. There would have to be an interesting story behind the character's return beyond just nostalgia, And it would need to be logical as well. Plus, Shatner also mentioned that he is currently busy enough with his own projects, And that he\u2019d be fine leaving his Star Trek ties in the past. William Shatner is currently serving as the host of the History Channel\u2019s The UnXplained, Where he explores some of the great mysteries surround mankind and the world around us. He\u2019s also recently appeared on an episode of Ancient Aliens alongside some of the foremost experts on the existence of extraterrestrials, As it were. Shatner definitely still has a curious mind, Which is the kind of thing that Star Trek inspired. While an appearance on Star Trek: Picard or Discovery may not be in the immediate future for Shatner, The actor and producer has been keeping fans entertained with multiple self-quarantine updates to the tune of James T. Kirk\u2019s famous captain\u2019s logs. If that's the closest we'll ever get, It was still worth it. Despite William Shatner's absence since his final performance in Star Trek Generations, Role reprisals in this franchise aren\u2019t all that uncommon.

It was, To some fans, Considered the worst death scene in all of Star Trek. Malcolm McDowell, Who played Soran in the movie, Couldn\u2019t agree more. But fans could have seen Captain Kirk die an even worse death\u2014by being shot in the back. Pose this one for me (to the powers that be): If you have \u2013 which they had \u2013 this icon of American television, Why the hell didn\u2019t they give him a spectacular death? Why did they give him such a really paltry death? Me shooting the bridge out or some BS whatever it was? They should have sent him off in a glorious fashion, And they didn\u2019t. They missed an opportunity. That how his death was originally scripted, And after many, Many reshoots, The powers that be decided the bridge was the way to end the captain\u2019s life. McDowell said an opportunity was missed because Kirk should have been sent off in glorious fashion. In reality, Though, There was absolutely no reason for Kirk to have to die. There was no passing of the torch as Star Trek: The Next Generation had already produced seven seasons, And like the other characters of the Original Series, Kirk could have made appearances in future movies, Including the Kelvin timeline movies like Leonard Nimoy did. That was another missed opportunity. In follow-up novels, Kirk was resurrected by William Shatner, But that hasn\u2019t been added to any movies or series as canon. With all the new series available (and the ones coming soon), There are a multitude of opportunities for Kirk to be involved and to be given a hero\u2019s death if that\u2019s necessary. Much like the way Data died in Star Trek: Nemesis. Being killed by a bridge is not any better than being shot in the back.

And while the upcoming series does have its own stories to tell with new characters to flesh out and old characters to return to, Kirk is a rising star in this timeline as he becomes the youngest captain to helm a starship when he eventually takes it over from Pike. Obviously, That means he\u2019s making waves in Starfleet long before that. So to leave him totally out of the equation would, To me, Also leave a gaping hole. Do I think he needs to be in all of the episodes? No, But I do think a younger Kirk should be introduced, If only to Captain Pike. Perhaps Pike could even learn that Kirk is next in line to captain a starship. Knowing his future, It might provide some comfort that, Potentially, His ship could be in good hands with Kirk at the helm. And with other\u00a0fans a little unhappy\u00a0with how Kirk has been jettisoned in the three new series, It would provided a sense of continuity and be a give-back to fans who started with the Original Series. Strange New Worlds is going to be set in the timeline which will allow the introduction of Kirk, And even though it might only be for a few brief moments or even an episode, I think it\u2019s important that he makes an appearance. To ignore him in the world in which he exists wouldn\u2019t be equitable to the fans because many of us will be asking where he is and what he\u2019s doing during Pike\u2019s command of the Enterprise. It would be much better to give us a glimpse into Kirk\u2019s life or, At the very least, Acknowledge that he is part of this timeline, Than to make us wonder and hope to see him. Yes, The show will be about Captain Pike, Spock, And Number One and their adventures, But leaving out the man who would captain the Enterprise in the future doesn\u2019t seem right. Having him appear briefly would not cast a shadow for Pike to crawl out from under nor would it detract from the series.

One famous actor has shared a story about the time they got pulled over by the police\u2026while wearing their Star Trek costume. Read on to get all the info about this funny incident, Including what the police officer had to say when they saw a Starfleet officer behind the wheel. William Shatner Was Pulled Over in Costumewilliam shatnerEthan Miller/Getty ImagesWilliam Shatner speaks during Comic-Con International 2015. The story goes that, While filming one of the Star Trek movies at an undisclosed desert location, William Shatner drove to set while wearing his Captain Kirk costume. He was pulled over by the police very early in the morning because he was speeding. However, The officer was apparently a fan, And let Shatner go, Exclaiming \u201cLive long and prosper\u201d to the veteran actor. It\u2019s a tale that Shatner\u2019s told a few times over the years, Including at a Q&A in Nashville back in 2020. Shatner also recounted the tale under his own byline for the Daily Mail back in 2008. The two accounts are more or less the same, With a slight difference in how the police officer behaves before delivering a \u201cVulcan salute\u201d to Shatner and sending him on his way to the film set. Here\u2019s the 2008 account in Shatner\u2019s own words:I got out of my car, Dressed in my uniform. The police officer looked me up and down, Frowned and asked: \u201cSo where are you going so fast at this time in the morning? \u201dI told him the truth: \u201cTo my spaceship. \u201dHe sighed. \u201cOK, Go ahead, \u201d he said, Before adding the Vulcan blessing: \u201cLive long and prosper. \u201dIn a more recent telling of the story, Admittedly not in Shatner\u2019s own words, It appears that the officer may have stepped away for a moment before ultimately releasing Shatner, Which does ratchet up the tension in the anecdote.

Up until today all this talk about a new Star Trek movie was just that \u2014 talk. But today, In theaters around the world, Moviegoers seeing the ever-so-hyped Cloverfield were treated to the teaser trailer for Star Trek. This is getting real. The Future BeginsFirstly the previously reported description of the Star Trek teaser is pretty much accurate. The trailer starts with a welder who could be from any time and slowly reveals that he and swarm of other workers are building the USS Enterprise in a dockyard somewhere on Earth. Ominous musical cues punctuate flashes between black, Images of workers and glimpses of the ship in a dramatic fashion. Although shot in a highly stylized manner, The trailer depicts a very real\u2026very human\u2026kind of world of hard hats, Sparks, Grease and just guys getting the job done. Interjected into this world we hear the sounds of JFK and NASA during the heyday of the space race followed by the slogan \u201cTHE FUTURE BEGINS\u201d\u2013 which appears to be the message of the trailer. Everything old is new againThis is followed by Nimoy\u2019s \u201cspace the final frontier\u201d voice over, The reveal of the USS Enterprise saucer, The unmistakable Alexander Courage TOS sting, And the TOS transporter sound effect beaming in a title card stating \u201cUNDER CONSTRUCTION, \u201d the new TOS-style logo, And credits. These are all nice touches and should bring a tear to the eye of any Trekkie. By the time the \u201cUSS ENTERPRISE\u201d reveal hit the screen the audience in the theater I attended started to applaud\u2026a welcome sign for a bunch of young Culver City hipsters there to see the first midnight showing of Cloverfield. That being said, I wonder if the lack of the title \u201cStar Trek\u201d and the \u201cconstruction\u201d thing may be a bit too clever. The film makers always say they want to bring in the general audiences and it is not clear Cloverfield-like mysteriousness will work when you are re-branding something. The ship? \u2026out of danger? As for the look of the ship at first glance it seems much larger than what we are used to and perhaps that is the point. From what can be seen of the design it clearly retains the general shape of the TOS Enterprise, But we see far more TMP style detailing and the proportions seem different\u2026especially the engine nacelles which are ginormous. The design seems to fall somewhere in the middle between \u2018exact copy\u2019 and \u2018radical redesign, \u2019 possibly closer to the original than most might have expected.

Star Trek fans are social people according to the data and interviews for the Sociology of Star Trek. \""}, {"title": "The Myth of the Star Trek fan, Continued", "body": "The article continues \"Nearly 7, 400 people have been kind enough to help with questionnaires about themselves as Star Wars, Superman, And Star Trek fans. The process of studying the results has begun, And the preliminary data is telling. First, Some caveats. These questionnaires are not a random sample of Star Trek fans. The summaries of the data here does not apply to all Star Trek fans for that reason, But rather the people who answered the questions. Yet, It is interesting to see what the 1743 Star Trek fans who completed the Star Trek questionnaire discuss. Also, The questionnaires are only from those fans who are 18 years of age or older. Younger fans may have very different experiences or view regarding Star Trek. They are not represented here. With these caveats, Here is a few interesting facts about 1743 Star Trek fans. TNG is still the fan favorite, But no consensusThis does have implications for Star Trek XI. Next Generation and DS9 appear to be more popular among the 1602 fans compared to Classic Trek. The interesting question is which of the versions of Star Trek is the favorite among different fans or non Trekkers because these audiences are needed for the next film to be a blockbuster. What do you mean there was no one in costume? One of the assignments for the students who take my Sociology of Star Trek class at the College of Lake County is to attend a convention with a sociological perspective. Invariably, There is disappointment because the students wanted to see more fans dressed up in costume. This is certainly a media generated stereotype because of the focus on costumed fans. The media may not see costuming appropriately. Costuming is a creative attempt by fans to display their affinity for Star Trek. This active, Creative process often results in amazingly detailed costumed. Yet, The irony is that while the media focuses on this because of its interesting visual presentation, It often results in a denigrations of the costumed fans. Two recommended books for this topic are Will Brooker\u2019s \u2018Using the Force\u2019 and Heather R. Joseph-Witham\u2019s \u2018Star Trek Fans and Costume Art for Star Trek\u2019. For those who have attended a Star Trek convention, It is no surprise that only 8. 9% of the 1522 fans answering the costuming question mentioned they had dressed in a Star Trek related costume in the last 12 months. 25% of these fans mentioned that they had worn some type of Star Trek item of clothing (a hat for instance). More Star Wars and Superman fans discussed that they dressed in costume (22. 2% of the Star Wars 3306 fans answering the question, 12. 6% of the 1901 Superman fans answering the question). The two books recommended above offer several positive academic reasons for costuming for fans of Star Wars and Star Trek. Trek has the lowest rate of convention costume wearers\u2026\""}, {"title": "The Myth of the Star Trek fan", "body": "From the   Trekmovie. Com   website, An article in 2006 is titled \"The Myth of the Star Trek Fan\"| SEPTEMBER 24, 2006 | BY: JOHN TENUTO Sociologist John Tenuto shares some preliminary findings from his study of scifi fandom\u2026The concept of the Star Trek fan is a myth. Those attending Star Trek conventions see a variety of people that questions the simplistic view that all Trekkers are the same. Star Trek fans are multifarious in political views, Occupation, Demographics, And shape. Yet, The myth persists that all Star Trek fans are similar. Similarly geeky. Similarly minded. Similarly shaped. Similarly bereft of social relationships. This is not true. Never has been. Probably never will be. Origins of the stereotypeThe media certainly plays a role in the perpetuation of the myth or stereotype. Media coverage of the 40th Anniversary conventions focused on the usual issues. The media showed fans dressed in costumes because this is a interesting visual, Even though the majority of fans do not dress up for conventions (see CNBC\u2019s \u201cStar Trek Fans Say Beam to Las Vegas\u201d   and corresponding video for a good example). The media focuses on the consumer aspect of being a Trekker, Connoting that the fees for autographs or collectibles are problematic, Or that fiduciary fan expressions are somehow unique to Trekker experiences. When favorable, Media discussions of Star Trek fans often have two related features. First, The reporters or writers makes certain to distance themselves from Star Trek because they do not wish to be considered Trekkies. Second, The reporters will include one or two jibes at Trekkies labeling them as geeks or such similar disparagement. No better example of this can be seen than in the recent Variety article \u201cLove and money fuel \u201cTrek\u201d trips\u201d by Brian Lowry. This favorable article regarding Star Trek provides all this and more. The first paragraph writes that Star Trek fans\u2019 adoration of Star Trek is described as \u201cif more than a little geeky. \u201d The next paragraph then goes on to say, \u201c Granted, 40-year-old men wearing Spock ears must find love where they can get it, But in hindsight, There was much for them to like. \u201d Imagine what the article might have said if it had a negative view of Star Trek and its fans. The media discussions of Star Trek XI also include a focus on fans. Articles found at Trekmovie. Com show a tendency for the media to discuss whether the creators of Star Trek XI are fans themselves, Or how the film will meet the expectations of the Star Trek fans. Sociology, The discipline that I teach, Is a science qualified to discuss media myths. Sociology utilizes the scientific method to study what sociologist Peter Berger called \u201cthe world taken for granted. \u201d It is certainly taken for granted that Star Trek fans are what the media presents.

The concept of a \u201cTrekkie\u201d \u2014 a Star Trek fan that shies away from normalcy and social interaction \u2014 has long been part of our pop culture, But the stereotypes that have been perpetuated are both inaccurate and unfair. Sure, Fandom can be nerdy; but these days, It\u2019s a lot more socially acceptable to embrace geekiness of all kinds. And Star Trek, Like any other big entertainment franchise, Has an impressively diverse fan base. NASA scientists, Billionaire Richard Branson, And celebrities like Mila Kunis all count themselves as Trekkies.

And then there days when your world crumbles because you learn Eddie Murphy was THIS CLOSE to appearing in 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Yeah, The whale one. Our Beverly Hills Cop was almost in the whale one. In a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Steve Meerson - one of the writers of the screenplay - reveals that Murphy was up for a small part in the movie. As we all know from our homework, The Voyage Home revolves around the Enterprise returning to 20th century Earth to bring a pair of humpback whales back to the future. \"It was always the same story that got approved, But the original draft included a part for Eddie Murphy, \" Meerson told THR. But why Murphy? \"Eddie was on the lot at Paramount at the time and arguably was the biggest star in the world, \" Meerson said. \"They had told us he was a huge Star Trek fan. \"(Actually those of us who saw Murphy's 1992 movie Boomerang might remember that his character also loved Star Trek.

It\u2019s the first time the French character has been featured in an American comic book, And it\u2019s designed to coincide with the character\u2019s 55th anniversary. Barbarella was originally a French erotic scifi comic book series, Created in 1962 by Jean-Claude Forest. The comic book series arrived during the height of the Sexual Revolution, With Barbarella serving as a figure in the fight for sexual freedom in the genre. \"The scifi heroine might\u2019ve been a comic book figure in Europe, But those in the states likely remember her best from the 1968 Jane Fonda film, Where Barbarella learned the pleasures and evils of sex centuries after war and intercourse had been abolished.

These days, Barbarella\u2019s original intentions are sometimes lost in translation, Especially given the comic and film\u2019s focus on the male gaze, But her role as a sexually liberated icon is still just as relevant as it was half a century ago.

His passing is a catastrophic, He looked after all of us, For me, The loss is personal, I had no better friend, And I raise my glass to him one last time. To James T.

Star Wars was special effects it was ILM(Industrial Lights and Magic) at its best. First of all Star Wars is derivative of Star Trek by 10, 15, 20 years whatever it was. DERIVATIVE! The only thing they had was. . . Our special effects as good as they were(laughs). God knows what those actors looked like in reality with all those special effects. I mean there's no telling what ILM did to those faces and those hairdos, They may have walked around with nothing on and they got clothed and made up by ILM. We don't know! There's no question that we puny humans on Star Trek facing that cold camera everyday were exposed to a far greater degree. Tight fitting clothes after lunch as well. There is a BIG difference between Star Wars and Star Trek and with J. J. Abrams piling on the special effects now uh I would say that there is a resurgence of Star Trek in a big movie frame that supersedes Star Wars. On EVERY level! Now look at that, I've just discovered something, Not only was the television show more humane and dealt with more human principals than Star Wars but now Star Trek has even more special effects than Star Wars. So Star Wars has nothing to expand on. Princess Leia is as beautiful as she was and as wonderful an actress as she is can't compare to the marvelous heroines that we had on Star Trek.

They argue that Kirk\u2019s continual shows of force are necessary for interactions with hostile or potentially hostile species. Kirk\u2019s ability to quickly assess the situation, Take decisive action and reach a solution is essential to space exploration. Those who believe Kirk is the better captain also argue that his ego is actually an abundance of confidence and charisma, Which helps him to win over those he interacts with. Kirk\u2019s self-assuredness makes it easy for him to connect with people, Which makes him very likable. His charisma makes it easy for him to negotiate his way out of the difficult situations he ends up in all too frequently. His outgoing, Suave personality makes him the perfect person to interact with new species and forge alliances. Perhaps the most common argument made by those on Team Kirk is that Kirk is the epitome of an adventurer. His courage and bravery make him willing to explore places and situations regardless of the potential dangers. He\u2019s the embodiment of masculinity, Willing to fight for what he believes to be right and to protect the vulnerable. He\u2019s a tough hero who won\u2019t take any nonsense or suffer any fools.

But did you know it\u2019s also sort of a follow-up to the 2009 JJ Abrams Star Trek movie? \u201cI don\u2019t think we set out to link it to the film deliberately, \u201d Picard executive producer (and 2009 Star Trek screenwriter) Alex Kurtzman told RadioTimes. Com and other press. \u201cIt was fun to be able to do that \u2013 when we made the movie, We couldn\u2019t have predicted this was coming 12 years later \u2013 but it\u2019s nice to be able to do that, And nice to be able to create a continuity of Star Trek. \u201dThis connection, Though, Is a little confusing given the fact that the recent movie Star Treks are set in an entirely new reality with different historical events and versions of characters. Known as the \u201cKelvin Timeline\u201d (vs the original \u201cPrime\u201d timeline), This separate continuity exists thanks to some time-travel chicanery that takes place in the first Abrams film.

The Original Series\u2019 Spock (Leonard Nimoy) attempts to save the planet but fails, Only succeeding in creating a black hole that gets rid of the supernova and sucks both his ship and one Romulan mining vessel (captained by Eric Bana\u2019s Nero) into the past, Splintering the rest of the film\u2019s action into the new \u201cKelvin\u201d timeline (so called because Nero destroys the USS Kelvin when his ship emerges in the past, Changing history). You can see some more of the details in the clip below if you need to jog your memory. \u201c[Picard is] in the Prime timeline, We\u2019re not in the Kelvin timeline, But the interesting thing about that movie was this was the one element of that film that was in the Prime timeline, \u201d Kurtzman explained. \u201cBecause it was the supernova, And Spock\u2019s jump that created the Kelvin timeline. \"In other words, All the events past this supernova in the new Star Trek movies take place in a parallel reality to the Prime timeline \u2013 but the Romulan supernova still happened in the main universe.

The result is a ship that looks more aerodynamic. One might say that the change was made simply because it \u201clooked cooler that way, \u201d but EC Henry points out that there\u2019s actually a practical reason for the change supported by scenes from The Motion Picture. Having the Nacelle struts at a 90-degree angle meant that had to dig deep into the ship, Limiting the amount of room that could be dedicated to the ship's aft cargo bay. Angling them back allows them to be attached to the ship at a higher, Thicker point on the ship's hull, Thus leaving room for a much larger cargo bay and even elevators for moving shuttles up from a lower bay to where the cargo bay door is. And the film does feature shots of Starfleet crewman working in this large cargo bay area with elevators. \""}, {"title": "Sexual Position called The Enterprise", "body": "From Urbandictionary.

Whatever the legal structure of the Federation (not something I would have thought about much either then, Or for that matter, Now), It was quite obviously just the United States writ large, Manifest Destiny boldly going where no Manifest Destiny had gone before, And I, Sitting staring at the television was paying plenty of attention. This enchanting exciting country called America was not only fun; it also appeared to be going places. It speaks volumes that the wonderfully entertaining Doctor Who, Deservedly British TV\u2019s most popular sci-fi hero of the era, Was played as an eccentric vaguely Edwardian gentleman, Whose travels through space and time could just as easily take him into the past as the future. While the original Star Trek offered occasional visits to yesteryear (Tomorrow is Yesterday, The City on The Edge of Forever, Assignment Earth, All our Yesterdays), Its basic trajectory was always forward-looking : the Enterprise hurtled through the 23rd Century with few signs of the backward glances and nostalgic appeal that made up so much of Doctor Who\u2019s very British charm. Star Trek was also, At its core, An optimistic, And to me, More attractive, Vision of what was to come than anything likely to emerge out of the U. K. , A Mission Control future of engineering savvy, Technical marvels, And big, Impressive machines, Something that I was specifically beginning to associate with that land of wonders apparently located on the other side of the Atlantic.

America, On the other hand, It was clear, Worked, And I was impressed. British-made tricorders? Wasn\u2019t going to happen. If I wanted the future, I knew where I\u2019d have to go to find it. And in the end, I did. Looking back now at the original Star Trek, It\u2019s striking to see how much of it came freighted with a strong ideological subtext. A veteran of the Pacific War himself, Star Trek\u2019s creator, Gene Roddenberry, Brought to the series a strong Greatest Generation sensibility, Both sharpened and softened by the tough-minded liberalism of the two murdered Kennedys.

The novel is a retelling of the film's events from the perspectives of various characters. Its final chapter depicts the Whills writing the film's opening text crawl. One of the Whills takes objection to the use of the word \"starfleet\" in a sentence, Which confuses another. Wait. . . \"Starfleet\"? Did you just say \"Starfleet\"? Are Kirk and Spock going to show up next? I don't even know what Kirk and Spock are! There's a big surprise. . . Do you know anything? William Shatner as James T Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as Spock in Star TrekIt's important to mention this chapter is written in a tongue-in-cheek tone (it openly mocks The Empire Strikes Back becoming the most acclaimed Star Wars movie), So it arguably isn't meant to be taken as seriously as other passages in the book. That said, The From a Certain Point of View novels are considered canon, Meaning at least one of the Whills is aware of other universes or franchises. This isn't Star Wars naming a new character Kirk as a way of paying homage; the text is a direct and very obvious reference to Star Trek's iconic duo. It's humorous to see From a Certain Point of View be so blatant, And readers who enjoy both properties should get a kick out of the chapter. If nothing else, It's an amusing way to conclude the book. \""}, {"title": "Young Sheldon again", "body": ".
