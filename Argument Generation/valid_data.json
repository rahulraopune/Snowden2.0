We live in an era of abundance where countries as small as Estonia are capable of producing the food supply for the entire planet. There is no constraint when it comes to basic necessities such as food, clothing or shelter. This is very different from the pre world war II era when the world still did not have the technical prowess to meet the demands of the world. It is different from the world where Gallbraid hypothesized that population growth will exceed the rate at which we increasing output. He was wrong. Today, the rich and poor don't fight for the same goods and services. Even though there is disparity between how much rich and poor earn, there is no pressure from the rich hogging resources such as food. If anything, the rich spend their income on lavish items such as yatches, cars and many other material items which although valuable are not necessary for survival. So what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the have nots jealous of the have's? I understand their are ethical issues with it, but what I'm more concerned with is, how income inequality can be bad for society, the economy or our general well being? Response to your replies A lot of you have pointed out that income equality leads to higher child mortality rates, health, etc. Although some of it is convincing, there is not enough evidence to support causation. Others have pointed out that income equality is cause of poverty. This assumption is based on the fact that we have limited resources and when equality rises, the rich hog more resources while poor are left with none. Again, I must urge that there is lack of evidence in this theory as well. The economic pie has been growing and the rich has been simply getting a bigger slice, and there is a legitimate reason for it. Since the wave of globalization started, the wealthy got even wealthier because they had seen their markets grow far bigger than ever before.

I, myself, don't really care whether my girlfriend hugs other people or not. I did use to be insecure as a teenager, but as people grow, as did I. Regardless, I don't really see the point of choosing hugs over personalized handshakes those special ones, you know what I mean , high fives, or any other display of affection towards someone. I understand why most men in specific have problems with this, because we don't express our emotions very much and maybe, to girls hugs is just hugs . But to many guys, hugs is hugs . Ignoring the extensive body contact, which is a huge problem to most, let's instead first consider the emotional issues this will lead to in a relationship. First of all, dismissing anyone's concern with a simple You're insecure, grow up leads to resentment, feeling attacked and growing distant. This will only be exacerbated if said by someone you trusted to support you. Of course, helping him become less insecure is the main goal, but you can't do that while simultaneously still doing the things that make him insecure. It's only going to reinforce his insecurity instead of decreasing it. Finally, the controversial part, where I want to know if my logic is flawed. Where is the necessity to hug people? Is there a strong compulsion in you telling you that you need to wrap your hands around everyone you meet? Can this compulsion not be satisfied with one person? And if there's no absolute necessity, then why do you still do it regardless of whether it makes your partner uncomfortable or hurt, and will obviously lead to a breakup? I understand it feels like it's infringing on your freedom, but he's not forcing you to stop otherwise it's a controlling or abusive relationship. By forcing, I mean trying to enforce this as a rule in your relationship regardless of your opinion . He's simply saying that he doesn't like it, and it makes him uncomfortable. This means that the choice is in your hands, whether to give something up for the relationship or to watch as it crumbles. As the rule goes, you have to give something to gain something, and it's most definitely in his choices to break up with you if he feels you're not respecting his feelings. This isn't only about hugs, it's about anything either one of you are uncomfortable with. Negotiations or compromise and giving it up are your efforts towards the relationship.

It is a good video Ok so basically I have found a bunch of facts from lawyers in ongoing cases, and from sources that I find more reputable than mainstream media that would say that believing that the DNC had involvement in the Seth Rich murder is in fact not a rightwing or internet hyped conspiracy. Towards the end I even have mainstream media saying incriminating truths. Ok, so lets get into it. I'll make a column of facts, . A lot of this is tied to the DNC Fraud Lawsuit, Facts The DNC Fraud Lawsuit was filed on June 28th, 2016 Seth Rich was murdered on July 10, 2016 Shawn Lucas died in a fentanyl overdoseafter he served Washerman Schultz's secretary in an online video. Seth Rich would have been a key witness in the case as he was the DNCs data analyzer. 13 05 Lucas like Seth Rich was a potential key witness to the case 7 45 according the DNC Fraud Lawsuit Plaintiff's lawyer interviewed in the link The DNC Fraud Lawsuit Plaintiffs lawyers applied them for protection as their were multiple instances of breaking and entering, and strange threats, including one from a call that was traced back to Wasserman Schult'z Florida Office, and other more disturbing threats including violence and threats referencing a murdered local district prosecutor Julius Assange and the former Prime Minister of England both say that the DNC hacks was definitely not Russia on multiple occasions. The prime minister goes on to say that it was a disgruntled DNC insider who was 'motivated by \u2018disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.' released the leaks, and NOT Russia. Thoughts I guess I think Seth could have been the leaker. He was the data anylasist, so he would have seen the truth, that Bernie had Hillary 7 1 from people under the age of 35, and that there was fraud and corruption going on that we will never even know about In the video where the lawyer for the DNC Fraud Lawsuit first asked for protection I thought it was just a PR stunt, or a plea for media attention. The second infowars interview just really changed my perspective, this guy actually looks scared. What do you guys think? 1st press release 2nd Interview Main Delta Change So while I still think this story is not getting enough attention because of the political aspects of it, with the FBI and CIA and all of our intelligence agencies releasing specifics of how Russia got into the systems, and with them tying Guccifer to Russia, the claim that Russia for sure was not behind the DNC hack seems at this time to be false and even absurd without good proof. Also someone mentioned that the rigging of the primary was not censored from the media and as I was looking at videos I found some good ones that showed this. The main delta had to be retracted as the 17 intelligence agencies story was a lie. Edit this has been debunked by NYT as propaganda, even though Politifact reported it as true quoting Hillary Clinton of all people. LOL. Edit 4 7 10 Latest developments, gonna have to take back one of my delta's because the 17 intelligence agencies was a lie, and in fact, the DNC never even allowed the FBI to investigate their servers. Instead they hired a third party company to seal their leaks Looks like it was Seth Rich most of amaleighs points still hold true and others I delta'd , it's just that they no longer justify to me Seth Rich being a conspiracy theory. He seems to me much more likely to be the DNC leak, seeing that Assange and the Former British Ambassador seem to think that a disgruntled DNC insider who was 'motivated by \u2018disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders.' released the leaks, and NOT Russia. the snopes article is titled horrendously erroneously, but its content is decent. my last point will be there is a 15,000 reward from Assange if the killer of Seth Rich is found, as well as a 100,000 reward from a Republican. So, yes, maybe it is a conspiracy theory, but compared to the Russia dialogue I would say it looks like a plain and simple murder with political and finiancial DNC fraud lawsuit motives. As opposed to the whole Russia Collusion conspiracy theory. Like here is the point, here I have tons of articles with clear facts, not from anonymous sources, video of security heads admitting they never saw the server. It went from 17 to 3 who have never even been in the server. What is more of a conspiracy? The Russia story which seems impossible due to the latest report or a plain and simple murdering a witness in a fraud lawsuit. So whether or not the DNC was involved in Seth's death, to call that jump a conspiracy, when you are blaming Russia with zero evidence is insane Here is Jimmy Dore's take on it which is an amazing video where the DHS claims it can't do warrents on political associations on camera. Here is the clear incentive to murder Seth Rich for political and financial reasons. People under the age of 35 voted for Bernie over Hillary 7 1 in the primaries, more than for Trump and Hillary combined. The person who would have been very privy to this information in the DNC would have been Seth Rich because he one of their data and polling analyzers, and would have had access to the computers. The latest meta data concludes that the files were copied locally as the prime minister and Julius Assange have been saying, meaning that Russia was not involved and Seth Rich easily could have been. A few months after the DNC Fraud lawsuits first hearing Seth Rich gets murdered as well as another potential key witness who was openly against DWS dies from a fentynal overdose. Not necessarily a murder but that is a very easy way to kill someone especially if they are an addict, just hire someone to sell them a bag with fentynal in it, they do their regular dose and die. Sketchy Sidenote This is the DNC hired family spokesperson for Seth Riches family who threatens to sue any news organizations who report on his death. another nail in the coffin. DNC refuses to let investigators get Seth Riches computer. Lol. how much more obvious can this get it's very obvious if they were innocent they would be trying to help the investigation, not blocking it .

However, the more I have reflected on the experience of a typical NFL game, the more I am starting to believe that removing all clock stoppages incomplete passes, time outs, after scoring, out of bounds could actually be a boost to the game. For the following reasons The now well known statistic that football games typically have only around 10 15 minutes of action For the average game time of 3 hours, this is slightly insulting. Especially, considering there is more than an hour of players standing around and commercials, it does not seem like reducing this time would be that damaging to the strategy that the game is proud of. Without clock stoppage, let's assume no added time for now , there would still be 15 minutes a quarter. The average drive seems to be between 2 4 minutes. That still leaves between 4 5 drives each quarter which seems to me to be plenty. Even if it is less say 2 3 due to the change over of players, chains, etc., this would still up the tension as each team's possessions would be more precious. 4th downs would be more exciting. The punt would be only used in extreme cases near the offense's endzone. Additional to the previous points, the games would be more exciting because 4th downs are statistically better used as ball advancing plays rather than for punts Would strategy really suffer? Maybe slightly. But chess is played at many different speeds and many prefer the pressure of the clock to the perfection of the strategy. Here it is subjective, but I would rather a few more pressure and emotion driven mistakes than perfection beating near perfection. I think that drives a lot of what college football fans love. The advertizing aspect would be tough to overcome and I do not understand all the commercial aspects. But UEFA FIFA etc do not seem to be suffering despite only showing commercials at half time. And perhaps the networks would be thankful for consistent game times. So this theory has been brewing in my head and it is not complete. I would like to see what I am missing. Change my view .

There would always be a chance to stop and strategize, just not stop the game clock. EDIT 2 Delta awarded for overestimating the number of possessions feasible or realistic in a game.

We just do not want to hear about them. We consider them as bad, weird, dangerous, while their sexual orientation has nothing to do with their own free will. Obviously gays can manifest their orientation, while pedophiles cannot. I'm not in favour of everyone manifest their sexual orientation, not at all. I'm in favour of everyone could speak freely about it without being condemn. The benefits for society are great first of all, healthy society is one which it's citizens doesn't hold any dark secrets. Coming clean about your sexual orientation and being accepted can actually decrease the illegal activities around it. Moreover, it's the rightfully moral thing to do. Accepting people for what they are, knowing that it cannot be changed. Just like we 'accepted' gays. Lastly, inspection would be much easier and treatments might be presented to calm down the sexual drive to those who need it."}, {"conclusion": "When someone posts that something is wrong on social media, but they say 'I don't want to talk about it' when someone responds, it's not always a bad thing; please", "id": 111720, "argument": "When someone feels something has gone wrong, but they haven't really figured it all out yet like what they'll do and how they feel, they can feel persecuted. Especially since humans have a tendency to victim blame once they do something wrong to someone, whether they implied they deserved it or they threw an insult or did something bad alongside a criticism that would normally have some time looked into in a healthy relationship which can be confusing and hurting you'll want to respond to the good part, by assessing the criticism, but you also can't because doing so ignores the context of the bad. Since they can feel persecuted, they won't respond to the first person asking about it, because they'll only respond if they're ready to and if the response they read feels right. It's not their fault they feel persecuted, and treating someone for posting that they feel bad on a social networking site or something and then saying 'I don't want to talk about it' to the first response is not bad, and you're reading into it if you think it is bad. Sure, some people may make use of social media with less than an honest intention, sometimes by not even simply knowing they are basically asking for attention or love with no intent of following through on explaining what they've gone through, but it is not bad every time and treating it as such is wrong. Social media doesn't have to be a conversation, sometimes people just want to express themselves, and when something bad happens expressing yourself is an adaptive coping mechanism that can lead to an answer but can't always be followed with conversation and that's OK."}, {"conclusion": "I am against religion in general but Christianity in peculiar as I think it's the most damaging things to our advancement.", "id": 84034, "argument": "I think this is true of all religions but I find Christianity is the worst religion next to islam which is very similar.

This is where my beliefs started. I'll be taking MDMA for the first time soon, and I think I'm worried about it. I've kind of felt sick for days, and it's kept me up at night just thinking about it. I know it'll be a great night, it's at a gig event with loads of cool music, and it's with my girlfriend so it'll be really good. She hasn't pressured me into it at all, but she wouldn't take it if I wasn't taking it, so I didn't want to ruin this night for her as she's really been looking forward to it and the MDMA .

In 2018 in the US, there were 5, 5 seat crossovers in the top 10 selling non pickup vehicles and of course, no wagons . This is partial due to the astonishing lack of true wagons available on the market. Objectively, I believe that wagons are superior to crossovers in just about every way and this disparity is simply due to marketing and perceptions about how uncool wagons are. x200B Advantages of wagons x200B Wagons have equivalent cargo space vs. overall body length see Jetta vs CX5 or E350 vs X5 AWD performance is no better on crossovers than AWD wagons. Wagons have a lower CoG and less body roll and thus far better driving dynamics. Wagons simply weigh less than similarly sized crossovers. This leads to better mileage, braking and acceleration. Wagons generally cost less lighter vehicles means less stuff than equivalent sized featured crossovers. Wagons use smaller rims tires which brings maintenance costs down and improves mileage and acceleration angular momentum of wheels . Lower insurance costs x200B Advantages of crossovers Higher driving position means better visibility albeit at expense of driving dynamics More headroom, especially in the rear seats. Ground clearance is higher although this is unlikely to ever prove useful for the typical crossover buyer Slightly better crash performance although this may be offset by worse driving dynamics, rollover risk, and accident avoidance x200B Thus I feel that wagons are objectively superior and that almost all crossover buyers would be better suited buying a wagon due to their objective superiority."}, {"conclusion": "This technology could be unilaterally distributed by a nation that may believe they'll benefit from it.", "id": 14153, "argument": "Some evidence suggests that implementing such a technology could result in droughts in India and increased rainfall in China, possibly incentivizing unilateral implementation Keith."}, {"conclusion": "Not all forms of life have reproductive organs, e.g. single celled organisms.

I'll take a few instances from this New York Times article profiling some migrants. A mother from El Salvador swiveled away from the fire where she was toasting tortillas at a migrant shelter in southern Mexico. Fleeing gang violence in her country, she had been traveling overland with her mother and her daughter, to reunite with her father in the northern Mexican state of Baja California. From there, she had hoped to find a way to cross into the United States with her daughter. A person from El Salvador in Mexico is not fleeing gang violence in her country. She's already fled it. She's now hoping to enter the U.S. because why? Or take this guy One of the men said that he, his wife and four children had fled Honduras because of violent extortion threats by a gang. They had heard about ruling by Mr. Sessions after arriving in Mexico. It was a dispiriting blow to their hope for American sanctuary, but it was not going to deter them, said the man, who gave only his first name, Alexander, out of fear the gang would track him down. Going back was not an option, he said, and remaining in Mexico was not much better. That left the United States, Alexander said, even if nobody seemed to know what would happen to them at the border. So Alexander is fleeing gang violence in Honduras, reaches Mexico, and decides, well I can't go back to Honduras, but I'm not going to remain in Mexico because it's poor? Can somebody explain to me why these migrants are not economic refugees once they've reached a relatively safe destination like Mexico?

Dense and sparse rewards A reward setting could either be sparse, or dense. An example of a sparse reward setting is a winner take all competitions. The rewards that people get are not proportional with their effort. Doesn't matter how much effort you put, if you are not the sole winner in the first place, you get zero reward. In contrast, dense reward setting is when people get rewards in exact proportion to their effort. A very common example is in MMORPG where you get a reward for every single monster you kill. There's also the issue about randomness and how that increase motivation, but that's tangential . Dense is better than sparse. Most people would thrive better in a dense reward setting. That's one reason why MMORPG are so popular and, for better or worse, addictive. That's why we break down big task to simpler tasks, to get a sense of achievement for every single mini task we finished, to keep us motivated along the way. Education is sparse. For some people who loves learning just because, education is not sparse. For people who loves getting good grades, for one reason or another, education is not sparse either. But most people are neither, they see education as a mean to an end, which is making money through gainful employment. There are also people who wants to get money without working, but that's outside the scope . For these people, education is very sparse. They have to invest their effort into 12 years to high school, and even another 3 4 years in university to make themselves employable. Only after that, they can reap the reward. This is the end of my main point. I'm less sure about the things I'm going to say below. Sparse is bad. This is a problem because most don't have enough motivation and self discipline to thrive in a sparse reward setting. This resulted in many students not giving their best in their studies. This is to be expected since the reward for their studies is very far away. Sparse is unjust. This problem is even worst for lower socio economic status people. People who are living in relative comfort are able to think in the long term, and thus, stay motivated in a sparse reward setting. However, conditions such as poverty, being hungry, feeling physically insecure due to conflicts at home, crime in the neighborhood, general anxiety by parents because they are anxious about their own future, will reasonably make people more short sighted. There are less reason to plan for the future, if you can't even be sure that you will be there. Thus, even when provided the same setting sparse reward , statistically, the rich kids will outperform the poor kids. Reducing social mobility and strengthening inter generational poverty. One solution is gamification. Schools are using something along the line of Khan Academy for math, or Duolingo for language, where you can get a 'grade' for 10 mins of effort, instead of the typical getting a 'grade' for a test assignment once a term. The problem with gamification is that a 'grade' is very abstract. While getting an abstract 'grade' might be a good enough motivation for some students, it is definitely not true for all. I'm even less sure about what I'm about to say below Dense education is possible. What is nearly universally true reward, is money. Not that they should be paid for studying, but that the whole society and economy should be structured in a way that let students to work as early as possible. That as they study more, they will gradually be given more responsibility, and more money in proportion. This is why I think trainee and apprenticeship is a better form for mass education.

They are NOT like any other mainstream pet you can get and should not be as commonplace as they are. Commonplace pets should be ones that require less time or attention, like a cat or a snake. I believe in most situations, most people are unable or unwilling to provide for dogs, and they shouldn\u2019t be owned as often as they are. If you disagree, please tell me why I love dogs but have only ever owned one. I am open to having my mind changed. That said, here are my three main issues My biggest issue They take more time to train than most people have. When I got my rescue dog I worked with her several hours a day for the first six months to a year at least, just catching up on basic training. And she was already extremely well socialized. Unless you are intentional about socializing and training, you are going to have a dog that is a pain to you and everyone around you. They need more exercise and brain stimulation than most people are able or willing to provide. It is unethical to get a smart or energetic breed many of which are very commonly owned dog breeds and leave it in a boring backyard or crating it while you are at work. I understand some people work from home, are stay at home parents, or are retired, but most people are employed and leave their dog alone 9 to 10 hours a day. Note that I do crate my dog while at work, and my dog naps all day regardless of it is a weekday or the weekend, so this point depends highly on the dog. They can be dangerous or unpredictable or at least a major pain in the butt if the above two qualifications are not met. It seems like half the dogs I meet are barely under control, possibly for these reasons. It is unfair to impose your annoying scary dog on others who might not like dogs or more specifically, might not like YOUR dog . That said, all you good dog owners out there rock on But I think there are far more \u201ceh\u201d or \u201cew\u201d owners than there are good."}, {"conclusion": "I feel very little sympathy for most smokers and feel justified in actively judging them for their addiction,", "id": 4954, "argument": "I remember hearing a quote somewhere, along the lines of If you saw an anthill at the side of the road, you would simply ignore it, as opposed to showing it your cellphone, and saying, Look at the technology we bring you or something similar.

Much like how we on earth could count thousands of beetle species, for example. Now on an individual interest, you may be fascinated with these 'primitive' type 0 civilisations, but you know that as a collective they pose no real interest or threat to your civilisation. Imagine trying to convince your countries government to put massive funding into researching beetles and their lives, and how you could even learn from them, it would never work. Essentially the view I'd like changing is I feel we give ourselves a heightened sense of purpose or worth within the universe, and I don't blame us for feeling that way.

I think the argument is separate from the concept of determinism. That is, I believe the claim I have free will is no different from determinism is false and that the distinction of objects into categories or a gradient from has free will to doesn't have free will is wrong regardless of the correctness of determinism. There is no expectation that these properties represent anything observable. If I introduced you to two humanoid looking things that display some amount of intelligence and told you that only one of them has, say, free will , you would not expect to see any difference between them, let alone guess which one has it. In that sense these properties are useless. While these properties have slightly different meanings, their purpose seems obvious to me to distinguish humans as the best of all things. They readily come up when trying to explain, for example, why humans are different form machines . They serve as excuses very well, it seems likely that this was their intended purpose and therefore unlikely that they have any deeper usefulness. All of these properties if viewed as gradients correlate with complexity also with intelligence . That is, a stone has no moving parts and nobody claims that stones have free will. The moon, while in motion and has observable action on the sea, has no consciousness unless you are a pagan . Viruses or bacteria have even more complex behaviors and, although generally understood not to have any of these properties, an argument could be made that they do. At the end of the spectrum is the human brain, understood very little and believed to have all of them. While complexity is also a bit vague, it is much more well defined than these properties. It is not obvious that the correlation with complexity or intelligence is not 1, i.e. that these properties are actually distinct from it. Consciousness seems to be an odd one out, in that there seems to be no disagreement on whether humans have it. Considering that the previous points apply to it, I propose that consciousness is something intelligent systems do. That is, being aware of a thing is an inevitable side effect of having a representation of the thing in your brain. If you suggest that your brain represents many things you're not directly aware of, I'd reply that those parts of your brain are not directly connected to your vocal chords and thus can't say what they are or aren't aware of. I believe that this is a sufficient and also the simplest explanation. While I can imagine that consciousness could refer to a property that some intelligences have and others don't thus being a useful concept , I think such usage would be far enough from the current use to be considered a distinct concept."}, {"conclusion": "The supposed loss of privacy due to public police surveillance cameras is morally acceptable in return for improved security", "id": 101956, "argument": "If it means everyone is safer and can reduce crime, isn't it morally the right thing to install police surveillance cameras in public?

To sum it up, a gigantic network of ghost writers had been producing quality essays for students with questionable English for over 5 years and no one noticed nor cared. More information can be found here h My question is the solution is to cheat in response? Much of the prevailing anti cheat wisdom asserts that a habitual cheater will eventually run out of options and that his misdeeds will eventually catch up to him. In the real world, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Morality and afterlife concerns aside, it seems in this case there are limited disincentives to cheat. Consider the following examples Ex. 1 An international student pays someone to write all of his essays in college, majors in Economics Math, perhaps cheats in that field as well, but eventually embarks upon a career in which recruitment is heavily institutionalized and therefore prone to having leaks in the system. Given that there are banks that hand out offers without actual face to face meetings, there\u2019s a high likelihood that this kid completely flies under the radar. It\u2019s not like high level English is necessary for making pitchbooks, nor is econometrics necessary for running an lbo model once he\u2019s in, he\u2019s in. Ex. 2 Student pays for someone to take the SAT for him, has his parents write his high school and college application essays, and gets into a target school. Or he disingenuously declares himself to be of Native American descent. He majors in the humanities, finagles his way into aforementioned institutionalized recruiting process through \u201cnetworking\u201d, and never applies to graduate school of any kind, thereby eliminating the need to ever again take a test. Sure, he has to put in the hours, but he\u2019s already assumed to be smart once he\u2019s obtained the requisite pedigree. In both cases it is not immediately when, if at all, the cheating that took place will actually manifest itself in some negative way in their career on the contrary, the effects seem mostly positive success compounds upon itself and someone that manages to find a job at a prestigious institution from the get go is more likely to move to the next prestigious step than someone that \u201cdid the right thing\u201d. Deficient skills will likely be corrected for on the job, in less time than it would have taken to learn them in undergrad. The idea that \u201ccheating will eventually catch up to the cheater\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply because the hardest part appears to be getting in, and things actually get easier as one progresses through the system. I guess my main question is in a world where individuals can be born with tremendous advantages and pedigree wealthy parents, a privileged education and upbringing, pre existing social networks, and pretty much a job in hand no matter what the hell happens, has your view on cheating changed? Do cheaters really win?"}, {"conclusion": "Depression is a well-known psychological problem of modern society that is partly caused by tv watching:", "id": 4281, "argument": "Republicans often bash government and celebrate the individual over government, as if we don't live in a democracy, where government is of, by, and for the people.

As someone who is a strong agnostic, I find this argument to be pretty convincing. Atheists argue that they are not religious because the don't believe in God, but I don't think the belief in God is needed to act in a religious manner. When I say that, consider how a religious person acts when you question their beliefs. Regardless of how well you can construct an argument against it, they will stick to their guns because of an emotional, personal connection to their belief. This exact same behavior is seen not only in Atheism, but in other philosophical realms as well. Try to question a person's politics and they will stick to their guns, even if all the evidence is against them. Some people change their minds, but it's not typical. They do this for the same reason They are emotionally invested in the ideology, and probably have a personal connection to it since they were brought up to believe it's true. Other parallels between Atheism, Politics and religion. All use rhetoric to attract loyal followers. All of them believe that their way makes the world a better place and any other way makes it worse. All congregate in groups and shun other people. All are convinced they are right, mostly for reasons based on feelings or personal connection rather than logic and all of them have famous figureheads that are looked to for source material. Religion has prophets, Atheism has sort of Anti preachers like Hitchens, and Politics have loads of founders who wrote manifestos or books that are seen on a near holy level. I think that if you have an ideology you defend passionately, whether it's Christianity, Atheism Secularism, or some sort of ideology of the left right paradigm, then you are pretty much religious.

He can see that stopping a genocide would bring about a greater evil. Perhaps the lose more souls to hell, which is way worse than losing life on earth.

I do not support Alex Jones, or anything he has said, but I think he should be allowed to have his own views and publish them if he feels necessary. Freedom of speech should not be controlled just because it offends someone. What I find particularly interesting is that all conspiracy surrounding Sandy Hook has been taken off YouTube, which put forth some very interesting points. Points that are difficult to find now. There was a Facebook page created for the Sandy Hook event the day before the event actually happened. If you take a look at the news coverage the event, there was just people walking in circles through the building and then out the other side. It was rather disturbing. you could tell they were the same people because they were wearing the same clothes Crisis actors this part is undeniably true. Some of the parents they interviewed were also seen in other news stories Again, almost impossible to track down now that everything's been taken down . Gun control has been a hot topic, and shootings like Sandy Hook acted as poster boys for the cause. Again. I think kids died.

You can always pitch a tent and go live in the woods like our hunter gatherer ancestors used to. If you derive value from society and modern civilization, you also have to give back and provide value in exchange, we do this through money. If you're working a fast food job and that doesn't allow you to provide value equivalent to what you want to derive, you don't have to. If you have health issues, you have to exchange the value you created for society to derive value from doctors and medical research. x200B That is not to say that a society cannot be compassionate and choose to provide healthcare or a basic income to those in need if the society deems that doing these things will ultimately benefit itself.

I'm just curious to find out what are people's view on this topic. Also, if you are suicidal now, I urge you to stop reading this post right now. I'm not here to convince anyone that they should just die. You should also not be here just to convince yourself that you should die. To put it succinctly, I've come to the conclusion that my life is not worth living. Don't worry I'm not going to kill myself for reasons that will be stated later on. I'm just in a dilemma over this. I'm torn between wanting to die for myself and being obliged to live for others. I have a few reasons why I think this way Life is too hard for me . Every action requires energy and effort. All our efforts of every living creature is used to produce some outcome that we define as favourable. All our efforts lead to the experiences we share. Personally, I've looked back on my short 20 years of life and I feel that all the effort I've put into it and the efforts of others around me isn't worth the experiences that came out of it. Like everyone else, I've had both good and bad experiences. The sum total of those experiences isn't worth the sum total of my efforts. Honestly, I'd rather die now and become an inanimate object than continue putting any more effort in life. Dying is so much easier. Life requires too much effort and energy. I'm tired and I feel that it's my time to go. Reality has no objective value. We, being human and alive, assigns everything with a certain value. We value our material possessions. We value our experiences. We value our relationships. We value our emotions. We value our rights. Everything has some value to us. But if you think about, and I mean really think about it, there is no purely objective proof that anything has value. Purely objective here means being perfectly logical and not being based on opinions. No one has a purely objective proof that anything has value. Every action thought situation that has ever existed and will exist are simply facts. They don't mean anything. They only have meaning, have value, because we humans feel like valuing it. But in reality, if say all of life on Earth were to be wiped out instantly, there is no value in anything. There are no emotions, no purpose, no value in an objective reality. There is no proof of any objective value in anything that has and will have happened. Therefore, my life and also my death has no objective value. I instinctively want to die. Without considering that I feel my life is too hard for me to live and that there is no purely objective value in anything, I feel that my body and mind are telling me to stop living. Ever since I was young, I've always been an unhappy person. I wasn't sad or upset, I was just not happy. Then when my dad passed away unexpectedly, I gradually became depressed. Then I became sad and upset. It seems that I am naturally genetically predisposed to loathe living. I'm just born this way. Everyone always says to do what you want to do and follow your dreams etc etc. So I'm telling the world now, I want to die. I dream of dying in my sleep. I fantasize about the different ways I could lose my life. I crave my death. Does that mean that I should do what I want to do and kill myself? Apparently, society deems that I shouldn't just go die. Then if I can't follow my urges, instincts and subjective opinions, then that means I should follow some objective purpose or meaning. But there is no logical proof of any objective value. What then should I, a person who looks forward to his own demise, do? Do nothing? I'm stuck. I acknowledge that there are reasons why people choose to live and find worth in their lives. People live to experience all that life has to offer. People live because they believe that there is some objective value to living, they just can't prove it don't know it. People live because their bodies are biologically coded to sustain life as long as possible. But for me, life experiences isn't enough and not worth the effort. Proofless illogical subjective objective reasons to live aren't convincing enough. Everyday I think about my death and wish for it. How then am I expected to live this life? What do I do? What should I do? Personally, I've chosen to fight my instincts to kill myself because of the people who care about and love me. I know that my death would upset them. As much as I feel that my emotions and wants and opinions are objectively worthless, I still do not wish to cause anybody pain. But now, I am in constant agony. I'm obliged to not do what I want to do. I'm stuck. To anyone who got this far into my rants and is getting triggered by my words and wants to die like me, please PLEASE stop reading now. I'm so sorry if my rantings hurt you. I don't wish to cause anyone pain. I just want my pain to stop. TLDR. If you've made it this far, I thank you for your effort and time. I hope that perhaps someone can give me a logical proof that life is indeed worth it. If that isn't possible, then I hope that someone can logically validate my death so that I can make the final decision with peace. Emotions, needs and wants aren't enough for me. If they were, then I would dead now. What I need is logic. I need something more to show me a direction. Maybe even something beyond human comprehension. Any and all responses are welcomed. I sincerely want to thank anyone in advance for their reaction. And yes, I know it's paradoxical to ask for people's opinions when I already stated that I want a purely objective and logical response, lol."}, {"conclusion": "Countries with hotter climates contribute less to the world", "id": 34505, "argument": "I believe that countries with hotter climates contribute less to the world as a whole.

To maintain a free state the power needs to reside in the people, if this doesn\u2019t hold true then it means the government doesn\u2019t need the consent of the people to make decisions. Guns also have many other benefits, like defense against robbery, and an impressively high success rape prevention rate. Conservative estimates of deterrence against crime with guns are 1,900,000 yearly in the USA. Gun control is an ineffective way of attacking gun violence. A full gun ban or a ban on \u201cassault rifles\u201d has never conclusively been proven to reduce homicides. In fact the gun ban in England only caused homicides to rise, and to this day the homicide rate hasn\u2019t been lower than the year the gun ban took action.

I will ignore AGP AAP for now as it does not apply to my views but there is a lot of overlap when it comes to that and gender dysphoria. There is early onset gender dysphoria and rapid onset gender dysphoria. Those who have ROGD are more likely to get over it and live out their lives happily. Those with EOGD will never be satisified with their situation and will likely end up killing themselves. Most people have ROGD and all of those people who fall on the nonbinary spectrum have ROGD. Those people are likely to be happy, even if they end up transitioning and not detransitioning. People with early onset gender dysphoria are the ones who suffer the most from this mental illness. Transition has never been a cure, and it has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of gender dysphoria. But is it the gender dysphoria of those with ROGD or EOGD? Because for most of the people in the trans community, they never felt like this is who they were when they were young. I am very biased on this topic as I do have early onset gender dysphoria and have tried everything to reduce dysphoria and nothing has worked. I have accepted that I will never be happy and this life isn't for me. I have a mental illness that nobody cares about properly treating. I have tried therapy pre transition, and completely transitioning has been a last ditch attempt at happiness. People are so concerned about identity politics that they don't care about the actual research to make dysphoria go away. Surgeries, hormones, therapy, none of it helps. They all appeal to those with rapid onset gender dysphoria. There is limited research done on those with early onset gender dysphoria because in this society, we are a rare minority. I believe that trans awareness has only brought attention to those who have ROGD, and brought their issues up to the surface. Those of us who have had EOGD for years, before puberty will be left behind and ignored. I am not a transmedicalist because I don't believe that transitioing helps anybody except those with ROGD and even then, it's a 50 50 depending on severity.

Yet when their eventual punishments come down the pipeline, it's never ever as harsh as when a male teacher has sex with a female student. As someone who has worked with high school students in the past, I think it's the highest violation of trust to become involved with a student. I'm not looking to reduce the punishment on male teachers, but rather think we should prosecute women just as harsh as men. I guess it's good that this doesn't happen frequently enough for there to be statistics to point to, but even from a social perspective, we put a much larger stigma on men than women in this regard.

I support the tolerance of autists and other handicapped individuals, as I think we should be accepting of the difficulty of their situation and their misfortune. We should be generous in giving support to them. However, I don't believe that autists are simply different . Rather they are broken . Instead of bones or muscles that fail to work properly, it is the brain. I don't think autists or their behaviors should ever be considered normative. Their behavior is just an indicator of an underlying disease that should be fixed. My reasoning is that the condition of autism is based on the failure of neural circuits to learn properly. The synaptic pruning processes that are necessary for learning in neural circuits fail, causing predictive and learning deficits for the afflicted brain regions. We should view this ailment as inherently contradictory to the function of those neural circuits, regardless of the emergent deviations from normative behavior that may arise. The severity of behavioral symptoms simply help medical professionals determine who needs treatment the most though ideally a brain scanning method that can detect synaptic abnormalities would be a better indicator than behavior . I don't think this is merely a cultural issue either. Due to the No Free Lunch theorems, there is some universe where the failure of synaptic pruning actually improves learning and predictive capabilities of neural circuits, but there is no reason to think such a universe is anything like ours.

If you disagree with those subjects as examples, simply replace them with other core classes . The opinion being presented here is just that room should be made in the base curriculum for the science of emotion and mental health. Also, I\u2019m talking about a true approach to the topic throughout all most years of public school like how the other core subjects are taught. I\u2019m not talking about teaching kids a few basic social skills. We experience our entire existence through our minds, and the chemical and electrical signals going off in our brain largely dictate what experiences we have, how those experiences feel to us, and how we react to them. Mental health and emotion is an enormous scientific field which can potentially encompass the entirety of that human experience, which leads to the simple question how is such a massive field, one that influences so much of what human beings do, not being taught to some extent in our society as a core requirement? Core subjects like science, math, and history are similarly large, and obviously can't ever be taught in full to students in a matter of only twelve years, which is why paid professionals spend so much time and money deciding what to teach, when to teach it, and how. None of that implementation, however, is necessary to establish before first accepting that schools should teach the subject as a major part of the base curriculum. I'm asserting that they should. A student gaining substantial knowledge on the science of emotion and mental health is far more likely to be important for their life after school ends than knowing how to find the base of a triangle or where to place the semicolon in a sentence. Mental health affects literally everything in a person's life to a much greater extent than most things taught in public schools. Productivity, stability, cooperation, families and relationships are all greatly dependent on having a healthy understanding of one's own perceptions and emotions and emotional reactions and an understanding of how perceptions, emotions and emotional reactions work in others and how chemicals in the brain affect those things . To frame that concept in a different way, answer me this If you had a piece of ridiculously complicated engineering being operated, and you could choose between two operators, would you choose A. the person who at least knows some amount about how the machine works and functions or B. the person who has no clue how the machine works and functions We would choose A. I've mentioned this opinion to people in the past and many people try to argue mistakenly, in my opinion that teaching mental health and emotion should be the parents' responsibility. This makes very little sense to anyone even remotely educated on the subjects of mental health and emotion because it's obvious that the students who are most in need of education on mental health are the students who aren't getting a proper emotional connection upbringing from their parents to begin with. Those parents are unlikely to have much knowledge on the subject to begin with, either. If anything, based on that logic, it would make more sense to have the parents teach math and English and have the schools teach subjects of mental health. I don't agree with that logic, though. The only idea I'm officially presenting here is that public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health as a main part of the base curriculum. Obviously, as with any change of such a large scale, the transition would be very difficult and there would be generational gaps that would be a challenge to overcome. But none of the challenges involved with implementing the changes to the curriculum are a logical reason to be against the change itself. Public schools should teach the science of emotion and mental health and if such a transition is difficult, then it would be best to start making steps toward this change as soon as possible. This is a change that would likely take decades to fully implement and structure, but it should be done and would be worth it. If the base curriculum is about giving students the tools to make a positive and productive life in society, then an understanding of mental health and emotion is a necessity. For those asking or wondering \u201cHow could someone possibly apply information about how mental health and emotion function?\u201d the answer is really quite simple many people live life as if emotions are some sort of mysterious phenomenon that can\u2019t be understood, or as if it\u2019s so simple as one comment incorrectly put it \u201cWhen you cry you get sad, there\u2019s nothing more to learn \u201d that they forget how much of our perceptions and experiences are not actually based on what is truly happening externally, or what our \u201cgenuine\u201d reaction to something is, but on physical surpluses and deficits of all sorts of signals in our brain. The culture of ignorance surrounding these topics leads people to live somewhat blindly in regard to how themselves and other people function, which is not ideal for a satisfied and productive society for obvious reasons. For those asking or wondering Could you give some random examples of possible specific areas of study? Sure. With no particular order or level of importance, because it would take a giant team of professionals to actually design this curriculum chemical signals in the brain, electrical signals in the brain, how physical exertion such as tension in the muscles can affect one\u2019s perceptions and reactions, how other physical concepts like breathing and heartbeat are related to one\u2019s perceptions and reactions, the overall relation between the physical and mental body in general, the experiences that we have, how those experiences feel to us, how we react to them, how we perceive those reactions feelings experiences, how these elements function in society, how these elements relate to productivity, how these elements relate to our perception of well being and satisfaction in relation to what objective mental well being could be in the sense of what is sustainable and scientifically healthy for a person's life in society , how these elements dictate our goals and decisions in society, how these desires, goals and decisions can fluctuate based on both external events and stimuli and personal chemistry and cycles in the brain, how external events and stimuli can influence the brain's chemical and electrical behavior, etc. A final note sciences have to start somewhere. No one would imply that medicine just never should have been taught because some of the views taught in the past have been proven false or inadequate using the knowledge that we currently have and building from that is a natural part of the cycle of progression in different fields of science and this progression will continue to happen in the future. Mental health is a massive scientific field and as such there will be a lot of evolution that will take place in the future, but we can't fast forward to then, and then will never come unless we have a societal foundation to build off of, just like in any other scientific field. We should start teaching this subject and provide future generations a solid foundation to build off of like we've done with every other core subject in public schools' base curriculums. I should also note that saying math and English was not specific. I was just bringing up two random subjects taught in base curriculums. Interchange them with other core classes if you disagree with that example it's not really relevant to the opinion itself. Also remember not to confuse the science of mental health with the field of psychiatry.

I also don't really want this to be a console vs PC debate, but there will undoubtedly be comparisons drawn. I like PC and console gaming, bother bring different things to the table, but here are my problems with PC It costs a lot to stay current with a PC I made a computer a few years ago and have upgraded a part or two here and there. The computer I made cost me about 800. My current specs are listed at the bottom. The only thing I really upgraded was the videocard. 800 is a lot for a system that will really only be current for what seems to be about 4 5 years. After that point, you have to turn the settings all the way down for any game to not be choppy. An example would be Fable III, which had a dismal framerate, and was only slightly better when I turned everything down. I got used to it after a while, and beat the game, but it was annoying. This has happened to almost every game I have played over the past 6 months. I can't use Skyrim mods like ENB, and even having the settings at max with no graphics mods gives me a really choppy experience in combat. My computer was 800 when I bought all the parts, and 3 years later I have to run games on low settings, even when a games recommended system requirements are well below my PC's hardware. I hear people talk about how PC gaming isn't all that expensive, but the only people I see that can run the latest or even 1 2 year old games on the highest settings are the people who just bought a brand new PC or spend 1,000 on theirs. Compatability Issues I have run into this more than I'd like. I will look up some reasons that a game is running slow, and people will offer solutions. My most recent example is L.A. Niore. I am well above the recommended system specs for the game, but the framerate is 1, or nearly 1. The game is completely unplayable. I crash into a car before I even hear the sound or see the cars touch on the screen. People online were suggesting I move a .dll into the L.A. Niore file where the .exe is. These kind of workarounds are annoying to have to solve, and add to the frustration of PC gaming, especially when you frequently suffer from them. Bad ports or viewport coding I am not sure if viewport coding is the right terminology, so forgive me. I mean to say that some games simply weren't designed to be run the way you might like. Having to minimize a game everytime I want to browse the internet is annoying. Few games take the time to do this properly, and those include games like WoW, Dota 2 LoL and some others. These games let you run in Windowed Fullscreen so you can switch between. Another issue is that this feature lowers framerate understandably because it must redraw the game AND the stuff on the other screen. One example of a bad game would be World of Goo. This game was terrible, and I had a ton of technical trouble with it simply because I have two monitors. PCs require knowledge to use well With PCs, you also need to know what you are doing. This includes making a computer, maintaining it, and troubleshooting it. I am referring mostly to games with the last part. You need to know how to use those setting to get the most out of a PC game, and if you don't, you could have a terrible framerate and not know why. For example, my games usually default my computer at high settings, or close to high settings, but the framerate is usually terrible unless I turn down those settings. I have no idea why, and I try to troubleshoot each game. Some games work better than others at high settings, so it isn't consistent across all of them. So please, someone who can buy a PC and have it stay current, playing newest games on highest settings for a few years, please come forward and tell me how you do it. I get the feeling most of those people aren't telling the whole truth when they discuss the cost of PC gaming vs console gaming. I also wanted to mention that there are a lot of things I like about PC gaming, including mods and the fact that you don't need extra hardware like controllers and whatnot . Here are my system specs Intel Core 2 4400 2.00GHz 4g RAM nVidia 570GTX Asus P5Q EM mobo Windows 7 64bit EDIT I don't agree with the argument that you are offsetting the cost of a gaming console because you were going to get a computer anyway. I could get a Chromebook if my only intention was browser based games. Or I could get a 300 laptop that would be perfectly capable of simple tasks like word processing or Excel. I could even fulfill my job role as a web developer with a very cheap computer, so saying that you are already spending something like 600 for a computer, and the extra 300 is for the gaming part seems completely bogus to me."}, {"conclusion": "There is no point for the news to censor curse words.", "id": 117414, "argument": "I don't understand why the news censor swearwords from quotes.

These cannot be learned in a classroom. If anything, I could understand artists taking courses at a technical college to learn more about their trade, painting drawing etc. but see no point in paying 80,000 for an art school degree, when instead they could have created art on their own for four years. If you get your bachelor's in a science degree you are constantly learning, absorbing, testing, researching new ideas, theories, etc. When you get a bachelor's in drawing you just draw a lot. Now I DO see the purpose in a music major. Music is a true skill to master and understand just like science or math. However drawing, painting, acting, writing seem like they can be learned through personal practice and hard work. It seems a lot easier to become an artist through practice than many other things and therefore shouldn't be a degree.

STEM research produces superior materials, powerful algorithms, medicine, improved computer power, new infrastructure concepts, useful theorems, knowledge about the cosmos, biotechnology, improved chemical processes, energy innovations, agricultural innovations, etc. All of this is undeniably useful to the advancement of human civilization. Meanwhile, research in literature, history, art, music, design, theatre, theology, philosophy, etc. produces nothing comparably useful to any degree.

Humanities research produces new perspectives in literary analysis, modifications to art and music theory, knowledge about history, etc. In most cases, these products are utterly useless to society, and the few that are pale in comparison to even the slightest of innovations in STEM.

He is up for re election this year, in what is expected to be one of the most competitive Senate races. I believe that he will lose re election to his Republican challenger, businessman Mike Braun. Now, Braun was one of the three challengers Donnelly could have faced. Congressmen Luke Messer and Todd Rokita were also running. I think that, were Messer or Rokita the nominee, it would have been a very simple matter of, This man voted to take away your health care , and then Donnelly would win by 3 or 4 points. Even though Braun would have done the same thing, were he a member of Congress at the time. Braun is an outsider businessman, and that persona has been very popular with Republicans lately. Donald Trump cleared the GOP field with that persona when he ran for President in 2016. And so did Mike Braun in the GOP primary. Braun is also very wealthy, and he can self fund his race. He said he wouldn't do so in the general election, but he has broken that promise. According to the fundraising e mails I get from the Donnelly campaign, Braun is indeed spending his own money once more that's how he has out raised Donnelly, some of those funds have come from his own pocket. The primary was brutal, but seems to have been largely forgotten by this point. Right wing groups are already running numerous ads against Donnelly, calling him Mexico Joe and talking about how he supposedly profited off of outsourcing jobs south of the border. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have campaigned for Mike Braun, dubbing the incumbent Sleepin' Joe , since Donnelly is supposedly the least effective Senator. In addition, there is a lot of voter suppression in Indiana. A photo ID is required to vote, and some people, disproportionately Democratic leaning constituencies, don't have one. After the Supreme Court said voter purges were legal back in June of this year, there is no doubt that Secretary of State Connie Lawson will do that. A judge ruled that Marion County Indianapolis needed more early voting sites, but state Attorney General Curtis Hill is fighting that ruling, a fight that even Lawson, a member of Let America Vote's Voter Suppression Hall of Shame opposes. Finally, the blue wave appears to be receding. On FiveThirtyEight's average, the generic ballot is now D 6.2, where it was once D 13. And the reason for this is that the GOP is campaigning on the cultural issues, such as illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, and gun rights, which poll better for them than the economic issues. Back in December 2017, things were looking awesome for the Democrats. Trump's approval rating was mired in the mid to upper thirties, and they had just picked up a Senate seat in Alabama. At that point, I figured Donnelly would be fine. Now, Trump's back in the forties, and they appear on track to lose several Senate seats. For what it's worth, the only reputable poll we have of the race, from Gravis Marketing, shows Braun leading Donnelly by one point, 47 46. There is also one from SurveyMonkey showing Braun up by two, but SurveyMonkey is trash and everyone knows that.

Arguments against the efficacy of torture, while perfectly valid in refuting its practical use, do not outlaw it as a moral law in any sense. In other words, assume that we know the person being tortured is guilty, and that there is a reasonable expectation of positive results if torture is employed. Enough said of that. In short, I currently fail to see why torture should be seen as immoral as a rule. Particularly compelling to me is the ticking time bomb scenario . Suppose the police have detained a man they know to have hidden several children in a small gasoline doused shack somewhere out in the deep wilderness. In twenty minutes, a fire will light in the structure, resulting in a rather unpleasant death for everyone involved. If it was known that torture would likely convince the man of revealing the location of the shack, thus saving the lives of the children. Why should the police abstain from torture in this situation, since it clearly maximizes happiness or, at least, appears to me to do so ? Reduced to simplest terms, if torture was employed on a guilty person in order to save the lives of innocents, why would it be unethical to do so?"}, {"conclusion": "A UBI can help individuals self-actualize and express themselves creatively.

These effects include the ability to globally telecommunicate with any person connected to a global telecommunications network such as the Internet across the world and the what I perceive to be the decreasing nationalistic sentiment in many developed countries. I believe that the nation state as an international actor should also become irrelevant. I believe that there is no rational argument for curtailing any person's right based on their nationality or place of origin. Importantly, this means that there is no rational basis to curtail the right to freedom of movement between areas in the world. This means that I believe that visas should become irrelevant and access to public services provided by local or international public bodies not necessarily acting as a sovereign should be based on contribution to society locally and as a whole. This would mean that a person who is willing to work in a particular area and become a functioning member of that local area should automatically become entitled to public services provided. However, should they not be entitled to public services, then their right of abode would continue to be inviolable. There would be nothing to prevent local areas from co operating with each other to share the burden of providing public services to those unable to contribute in that area. There would be no cap on allowed entries to a particular area as this would interfere with the inviolable right of abode. There should also be no requirement of skillfulness to fill a skills shortage or language competency. I do not see my view as hypocritical I would be perfectly fine with unlimited immigration from any area, even if they do not speak the native language or wish to compete for skilled or unskilled labor, or wish to compete in the real property market. I do not see the conceptualization of the world as areas as essentially recreating nation states in another name. True it is difficult to formulate this argument and a model for this argument without reference to some of the terms used to describe a world of nation states. Fundamentally, the role of any such area in my model would be limited to management of the commons that being public services and utilities in such a way that does not interfere with the universal right of abode. Whether or not the world continues to operate as a normative system of federated areas or instead forms a world government with the capability of legislatively binding all people of all areas is not a concern for my argument. My argument is merely that the nation state as an international actor with the ability to interfere with the right of abode, should be abolished and declared irrelevant.

Why is it I can buy marijuana in California, smoke it and be fine and cross the border into say Arizona and be sent to jail. Why does CT have laws where you can't buy alcohol after a certain time but you can drive 20 minutes to NY, cross the border, hit up a gas station, buy it and drive back. Same with speed limit, I can say 60 on a highway in NY and the moment I cross border the speed limit changes to 70 or 55 or whatever. Like I said we're all equal as humans and should be treated equally across the country, why does an imaginary line, a border we've come to accept in these united states, determine my freedom under the law. I think it just produces more opportunity to really screw over the countries citizens. Is a person who is found legally competent and licensed to own a gun in taxes suddenly a danger to society if they cross the border to New York or Massachusetts? Why can't these be decided on a federal level and enforced countrywide? If geography demands something unique be applied to an issue in a certain town or city or county that would make no sense, or be out of place anywhere else then why not just have the local town decide that rule or law so long as it doesn't infringe or conflict with Federal. For example, and this isn't a perfect example, say in maybe Turlingua, Texas the name is interchangeable ,in this small town every Sunday there is a parade and the streets are filled with people and so driving the usual speed limit would be dangerous, and so the mayor and local gov, creates a low or rule saying that on Sunday during x time when the parade is happening you muse drive at x speed or whatever. That wouldn't apply to the whole country, just locally and I think that's how laws should be handled. It would help solve many issues, many pointless tickets and imprisonments and would make more sense when it came to voting for president or government office. x200B Edit also the same can be applied for countries and the differences between them, but lets do one major change at a time before talking about the complexities of uniting the world. x200B Now this might sound a bit frustrated, but is there any way we can just argue down in the comments instead of down voting good discussion and potentially hiding it from people?

In comparative politics, there is generally a division between two Systems of Government \u2013 Presidential and Parliamentary, two Party Systems \u2013 two party and multi party, and two Electoral Systems \u2013 Proprotional Representation and First past the post. Now, the party systems are pretty self explanatory In a two party system , like in the United States and the United Kingdom, there are only two parties with a reasonable chance of being in charge, and the government alternates between these two parties. Smaller parties may also hold some elected offices and even have legislators elected under their banner, but they never form part of the government. In a multi party system , like in France, Israel, and Brazil, there are many parties \u2013 at least three \u2013 with a reasonable chance of being in charge, and the government is frequently a coalitionformed between larger and smaller parties which can agree on a common program, with the larger party typically leading those coalitions. The Presidential Parliamentary distinction, however, warrants some explanation In a Presidential system , the Chief Executive has a popular mandate of his own, separate from that of the Legislature, and is typically selected in popular, direct, personal elections. The Government formed by him usually does not need majority support to survive, but even in the cases it does, the Chief Executive will still remain in office if majority support is lost. In a Parliamentary system , however, the Chief Executive does not have a popular mandate of his own, and he has to borrow that of the Legislature. This means that the Chief Executive is selected becuase the government he forms enjoys majority support in the Legislature, and if that support is lost, not only the government but also the Chief Executive himself have to leave office. The First past the post Proportional Representation distinction, is even more complicated In a First past the post FPTP system, whoever gets the most votes wins, apropos nothing. This is straightforward enough in a single winner election, but much less so in a multi winner one, so the most typically used solution is to do divide and rule the entire electorate is broken apart into many little districts, and each of those districts elects one person, instead of the entire electorate electing all of them. First past the post typically leads to the emergence of a two party system, since wasting your vote is very easy, and people start voting only for one of two major parties. In a Proportional Representation PR system, each party gets its own fair share of victories based off its performance in the elections. Obviously, this can only apply to multi winner elections, such as Legislative elections, and the most common solution used there is to use a mathematical formula such as the d'Hondt, Huntington Hill, and Droop formulas to translate each party's share of votes to a share of seats, and assign seats to each party based on that formula's results. However, I am also focusing on Presidential elections, which must be single winner by definition. So, to fill in that gap, I'm counting the two round system as Proporional Representation. Basically, in a two round system, having the most votes is not enough to win \u2013 there's also a requirement of having at least half of all votes. If no one gets that, the election goes into a second round, two or three weeks later, and only the top two candidates in the first round run in the second. Typically, this means that voters vote for their favorite candidate in the first round, even if he doesn't make it, and only break out the strategic voting in the second round. Proportional representaion typically leads to the emergence of a multi party system, since wasting your vote is much harder, and people start voting for whatever party their support in order to keep it afloat. So let's get to it The foremost example of a Presidential system in most people's eyes is the United States, which uses First past the post and has a two party system. Parliamentary systems, on the other hand, are emboided by the Countries of Europe, which use Proportional Representation and have multi party systems. Becuase of that, there's a comon consensus that Presidential systems are best matched to First past the post and two party systems, while Parliamentary systems, are best matched with Proportional Representation and multi party systems. But I believe that nothing could be further from the truth A Two Party Presidential System using FPTP is eventually bound for gridlock since there are only two parties with a reasonable chance of being in charge, the President and Legislature are either on the same note or opposed to each other \u2013 and that's only if the hypothetical legislature is Unicameral, since a second house leads to even more gridlock. Since there are only two parties, political discussion also also develops a wth us or against us mentality. Furthermore, the FPTP system can distort the voters' will since one party may win the most votes, but the other party wins the most seats in the Legislature or, if there's an Electoral College, also the President . However, if the Presidential System is multi party and uses PR, gridlcok can be more easily avoided It's just a matter of kicking the dissenting parties out of the government coalition, and replacing them with more willing allies. Since all parties can be potential allies of one another, polarizing rethoric would make a party's effective death, and even in the rare case where only one mainstream party advances to the Second Round, that mainstream party would enjoy the endorsement of nearly the entire political spectrum, leaving the small party on its own. The voters' will is also accurately reflected \u2013 not only does each party's share of seats in the Legislature is proportional to its share of votes, the two Candidates who ascend to the Second Round can and do also adopt policies of the minor parties which endorse them. The same applies to Parliamentary Systems A Multi Party Parliamentary System using PR would be prone to disproportionate influence by smaller parties \u2013 their approval would be required in order to gain majority support in the legislature, and any policy not to their liking would spell doom to the government of the day. In addition, since no clear mandate emerges from the elections, there could be conflicts the leader of the largest party may not necessarily head the resulting government. In addition, government formation may also be needed to be made mid term, as the previous government may have suddenly lost majoirty support. Regardless of when it is done, an unsucessful government formation would nearly always result in new Legislative elections. However, if the Parliamentary System is two party and uses FPTP, each of the two major parties will nearly always gain majority support in the legislature by itself, and would need not enter into coalition building \u2013 and would only lose its majority if the membership changes in the legislature tilt the favors against it. This leads to overall government stability. In addition, the lack of coalitions entails a lack of pandering to small parties, allowing the large parties to deliver their own policies more effectively.

I don't think that either women or men are the sole cause of the misery associated with being in a relationship. Rather, I think that any romantic relationship, in and of itself, is extremely volatile in its very essence, so much so that it's doomed to eventually end in anger, discontent and misery. Also, I haven't been in a relationship for months, so I'm not writing this, say, coming out of a bad breakup. Lastly, I'm not writing this as a form of indisputable truth. Rather, I am genuinely willing to have a discussion here, and perhaps to change my view, even if only partly. I'm currently 24 years old, so there might be a lack of experience on my part. Still, I think I've had my good share of relationships flings that makes me come to the conclusion I'm more consistently happy and contented as a single man, than I am in a relationship. I also draw upon the experiences of my close friends, who have come to me with their fair share of relationship problems. Of course, it goes without saying, that being in a relationship, especially in the beginning, can be very magical. It's one of the greatest rushes in life and with good reason passing on our genes is the ultimate purpose of life at the end of the day, so no wonder . Yet the pain that can sometimes result from a relationship can sting so bad, that the magical part is totally not worth it. I think the Yin Yang philosophy of life holds a lot of relevance here that which comes with great pleasure and contentedness, must also come with its fair share of displeasure and discontent. And it so often seems, that any relationship is destined to end, or at least be wracked with pain and discontent, often in greater extent than it is with happiness since the vast majority of relationships are simply far from perfect. This is because a romantic relationship, and in a broader sense romantic love, is extremely volatile. It's not mature. It's, more or less, a hormone driven sensation, a rush, that it so powerful, yet so susceptible to be a cause of disruption rather than ecstasy. When we love, we devote so incredibly much to one person, and expect so much as well. We are so preoccupied with our loved partner, so much so, that we become almost neurotic. A tiny gesture from our significant other can be a huge source of pleasure. Yet a tiny short coming can also have the same effect, only in the opposite direction. And even in the most perfect relationship ever, the ratio of good to bad is probably never better than 1 to 1. Without going into details, I have truly gone through some of the worst hours, days of my life because of relationships. Days that made me completely forget any kind of pleasure or happiness I had experienced in the course of a relationship. In other words, days that made me completely regret every getting into a relationship. Maybe this is my own personal negative attitude though. Feel free to chip away. Furthermore, as a person in a relationship, you almost always have to deal with the baggage of another individual, baggage being the most appropriate word possible too, because you literally carry their problems with you from now on, and not just your own anymore. Every person in life has their own problems issues. Everyone. And it's already difficult to carry one's own baggage through life, not to mention the baggage of close friends and family. In no other relationship is one's baggage literally doubled than in a romantic relationship, by virtue of the very intimate connection two people share in a relationship. Some would then argue, the significant other carries your baggage as well. I don't find this very consoling. I, personally, have never found consolation in sharing my problems and issues with other people. I like to keep them to myself, and work on them, by myself, and at my own pace. Another person's encouragement, even participation, doesn't do much for me. I would go as far as saying that it may even be annoying. Still, maybe that's just how I feel towards the whole sharing your problems worries with your SO. But it is what it is. And to top it all, and probably most importantly, I really think being in a relationship opens the door to a lot of negative emotions, which simply wouldn't find entry into your life, had you not been in a relationship in the first place. I won't dwell on this part, but these include jealousy, mistrust, infidelity, over attachment a drawback whether it's from your side or from hers, doesn't matter , anger and rage just to name a few. I also don't think that the positive emotions are in any way worth the trouble of going through the negative emotions. I ask myself, if I had the opportunity to experience the most exhilarating pleasure in life for one hour but with a catch I would have to experience the most horrible pain in life for one hour afterwards. Would I accept the offer? My own personal answer would be a resounding no. To sum it all up, I know that I may sound bitter after all of this, but I'm not. I've just found that consistent happiness and contentedness, all be it at a slightly lower level than that which could be achieved at the peaks of happiness in the perfect relationship, are so much more worth it than going through the ups and downs of any relationship. As a single person, I have much more time for my own personal development, my hobbies, my career. I just have more time and energy to take care of myself, and do the things that I enjoy and give me meaning. I also don't condone an asocial attitude or isolation I still have a good group of both close friends, and acquaintances, with whom I share my thoughts and emotions, and with whom I partake in the activities I enjoy. If I could sum this whole post in one sentence, it would be a consistent happiness of about 7 8 on a good day or a 6 on a bad day on a scale from 1 to 10 , is a lot better than having a 9 10 on some days, and a 2 3 out of 10 on other days that come with being in a relationship. x200B EDIT Well, this has unfortunately been downvoted to oblivion for some reason I'm not aware of, but a few good comments were posted here regardless, so no harm done. For those of you who discover this through Google or some other search engine, the main arguments that were put forth here were along the following lines Family and children regardless of whether one deems a long term relationship worth it or not, at some point or another, one will generally want to form a family and have children, for many benefits and disadvantages , but we'll leave that discussion for another day. Priorities change well, this is probably an extension of the first point, but alas, priorities do indeed change as one grows older especially between the ages of 18 and 30. At the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 etc, it may seem completely absurd to pursue any form of long term relationship. When one starts to approach the age of 30, the outlook and perspective one has on life begins to change as well. This may lead many, based on their own experience, who previously shunned the idea of having a long term relationship SO, to reconsider the idea. Finding the right person there really isn't much to expand upon here. Many find that the right relationship can be found by finding the right person. While I don't necessarily disagree with this wholly, I still think it's a bit optimistic. Still, it may prove true. My posting this thread is either proof of the validity of my convictions, or of the fact that I haven't found the right person yet. Only time will tell, for me, and for anyone else who shares shared my view. I think that covers it.

In my view, progressives inside and outside of the Democratic Party are driven by a desire to empower those who have been hurt by crony capitalism, namely the middle and lower classes. We support the pursuit of social justice through taming capitalism's ills through prudent regulations, higher marginal tax rates, a more generous social safety net, single payer healthcare, support for unions, support for public education, and more. We are against powerful actors who rig the political system in their favor, such as investment banks, corporate lawyers who work for said banks, pharmaceutical companies, tech companies, etc. Many progressives also strive toward racial justice, environmental justice, food justice, justice for undocumented workers, and more, and often times, we are pitied against powerful corporate interests. Therefore, when someone tells me that they are a progressive and support the Democratic Party, but also want to get rich for their personal gain, then I view them as a hypocrite. To me, in order to be a true progressive, you can't just vote Democrat, you also have to shake up the status quo. That means you need to volunteer and work for nonprofits and grassroots campaigns to some degree, spread awareness about issues, and personally get involved in pursuing justice. To me, being super rich while claiming to left wing like George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Michael Moore, etc is extremely hypocritical. I have a friend who worked on me with grassroots campaigns, but he was offered a job at Goldman Sachs for 120k right out of undergrad. I told him straight up that he shouldn't consider himself to be a true progressive anymore and he's a sellout. I also have another friend who considers himself to be a progressive when he practices corporate law helping huge businesses with mergers and acquisitions, and some of these mergers kill jobs , so I told him straight up he's not a progressive because his work doesn't help the disadvantaged and helps the powerful, and he's also a sellout to the corporate world. I'm sick of the limousine liberals the rich liberals in hollywood, on wall street, among rich lawyers, among doctors, among techies, etc. Most of these rich liberals genuinely do care about justice on social issues, such as gay rights, etc, and I appreciate that, but they are tainted and bought and corrupted by special interests on economic issues. Often times, they are liberal not because they actually care about helping the poor, but because they want to make themselves look enlightened and politically aware to their friends. And even if someone who was a rich liberal genuinely did believe in social justice for the poor and voted against his or her personal financial interest, still, I find it problematic for progressives to accept and welcome someone whose professional career was based upon making a lot of money for himself herself and his or her family, rather than working from the start to help the disadvantaged. As I said before, a true progressive is someone who forgoes lucrative occupations and financial success to work in nonprofits and campaigns to serve marginalized communities. I think it's ridiculous how so many Democrats praise people like George Soros, Michael Moore, hollywood actors, ect, as their saviors when these people are making a shitton of money for themselves and sending their kids to private schools and living luxurious, sheltered lives when the rest of America the 99 has to work extremely by just to scrape by. All these rich liberals do is donate some of their money and have statues built in their name to inflate their egos. I think it's possible to be a liberal supporter of the Democratic party and be rich have a lucrative job for self gain. And that's because the Dems have been infiltrated by Wall Street and the centrist Third Way ideology has taken hold since Clinton's presidency. You can support gay rights, abortion, some modest legislation to help the middle class, etc, and be rich, and there's no cognitive dissonance. But you can't be a true, pure progressive while also basing your career around personal gain. I'm viewing liberal Democrats as Hillary, Obama, etc, ppl who to some degree will help the disadvantaged but are bought by special interests to some degree. In contrast, purist progressives like Bernie Sanders are NOT bought and truly fight for the middle and lower classes TL DR If one of your goals is to become rich or pursue a lucrative career, then you can't consider yourself a true progressive, b c you are being selfish and acting in self interest rather than trying to help the broader community."}, {"conclusion": "Married parents are more likely to stay together than parents in live-in relationships.", "id": 118163, "argument": "Looking at data from the US, five years after the birth of a child 80% of couples who were married when they had a child are still living together, while only 39% of couples who were unmarried are still living together."}, {"conclusion": "It is possible to have widespread gun control while only inconveniencing legitimate gun owners", "id": 13610, "argument": "The bodily autonomy of the parent comes at the expense of the bodily authority of the child.

This drew a lot of attention on social media, but for all the wrong reasons. Twitter and Facebook were flooded with memes about how he is disrespecting the military and has no right to be upset because he makes a lot of money and has white parents The problem is that none of these personal attacks have anything to do with why Kaep is protesting. If you are going to start insulting him for not joining the military, then you are also insulting over 90 of the population in the US Furthermore, how much money someone makes and what color skin their parents have has no bearing on which issues they are allowed to protest. My view Kaep has made the intention of his protest very clear right from the start gt I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color , Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. source Kaep has also made it very clear that his refusal to stand has nothing to do with the military gt I have great respect for the men and women that have fought for this country , said Kaepernick. I have family, I have friends that have gone and fought for this country. And they fight for freedom, they fight for the people, they fight for liberty and justice, for everyone. That\u2019s not happening. source Despite Kaep saying repeatedly that he respects the military and did this to protest injustices against minorities, people still decided to take this protest and focus the conversation around how it personally upsets them. People are taking about how he chose to protest, or when he chose to protest. This seems like cognitive dissonance to avoid an uncomfortable conversation about the real problems in this country. I get that some people attach a greater significance to the National Anthem than most, and those people have every right to be upset, but if you are upset about that and not upset about the racism still in this country, then this protest was for you. It is okay to be upset about when he chose to protest and also why he chose to protest. I think my personal favorite group to come out of this are the, I fought for his right to not stand, but fuck him for not standing people. The hypocrisy would make me laugh if I weren't so aggravated. The thing that aggravates me is that the conversation is being dominated by people who only want to talk about how his actions offended them. Hardly anyone is standing up and recognize that the problems that Kaep is protesting is a real problem. And until we are able to get people to admit that there is a problem, nothing is ever going to change. You are allowed to be offended by the timing, but still agree with the message however, if you get more angry about a guy not standing during the national anthem than you do about innocent men getting murdered with no repercussions, then you are the reason why we need people like Kaep protesting. I'm not saying he picked the best timing, but I am saying people are letting that distract them from why he did it. This is a total copout. They are turning the argument away from racism and making it about how he chose to protest and why it upsets them personally.

Now, I know people absolutely rave about Game of Thrones, but from what I've seen, most of the show is about pushing boundaries and shocking the viewer. I've actually heard people that both watch the show and have read the books complain that the show seems to glorify violence and excessive sex, whereas George R. R. Martin was more trying to demonstrate the potentials evils of mankind. I just think the gore, ridiculous amount of borderline pornographic sex scenes, and sexual violence are all overdone in the TV show. I by no means view myself as easily offended or prude, but there is this depraved sexual energy to the TV show that I just cannot see past. It honestly kind of bothers me that they feel the need to cut from a graphic beheading to someone getting railed from behind with such regularity. I agree wholly with a blog I read that says all the distasteful, exploitative and dehumanizing sex with little informational context detracts from the show as a whole and is often frankly unnecessary. I'm just wondering is the abundance of shocking content really the crux of the show? especially how abruptly they'll cut to what pretty much amounts to softcore porn, or someone getting their eyes gauged out from up close, etc. . Is the level of shock value a bit absurd and unneeded for anyone else? or do you enjoy it? As I mentioned earlier, it seems like the books have more depth and don't glorify the sex and violence so much as include it as an unfortunate fact of the GOT mythos, whereas the show is getting further and further from the source material and even deviating intentionally at points to up the shock value e.g. depicting a consensual relationship from the books as nonconsensual . I've only probably seen about 10 hours of the show total, but the abundance of just horrible, horrible rape scenes and disgusting deaths I just don't get it. If Martin's intent was to portray humanity as multifaceted and deeply flawed, the show's intent seems more to be let's see how many breasts, offensive sex scenes, and horrible deaths we can include in one episode to reel in viewers to the point where the message of mankind's potential for evil is secondary to the visual displays themselves. ."}, {"conclusion": "The modern Marvel Cinematic Universe is a much higher quality compared to DC's.", "id": 60480, "argument": "Marvel Universe is better because it's philosophically more sophisticated including the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical problems in different comics from Dr. Strange to Avengers to Spiderman"}, {"conclusion": "I don't believe that \"open relationships\" are real relationships.", "id": 74539, "argument": "This has been a topic that I've been turning over in my mind for a while now.

I'm not sure that it even is I don't ever recall hearing of a person being charged with the crime of attempting to commit suicide . Have you ever heard of a person being charged with attempted suicide? Now if that isn't a crime, then how can it be a crime to encourage someone to commit suicide? Secondly, even if it is a crime to attempt to commit suicide, I do not believe that a person should be put on trial for words that they speak except in certain cases such as fraud or slander . I think that speech should indeed be free. If I tell you not to pay your taxes, should I be put on trial if and when you don't pay them? If I tell you to resist the draft, should I be held liable for that? If I urge you to drive faster than the speed limit and you crash your car and die, am I liable for your death?

She had a statue made out of her and became a martyr. But as far as I know she didn't inspire anyone during the war itself, she just became a nameless corpse until she was discovered. I have earlier exposed my views on the environment and the future of the planet Honestly I think that there is no hope since there are way too many billion dollar interest groups dedicated into blocking the necessary political action and protesting them will be like an ant fighting the sun. Same with stuff like the NSA and essentially all the growing evils in this world. If I fight them, I will suffer, I will die, and no one shall benefit. This is not cowardice, this is intelligence. Benefitting myself is better than benefitting no one. I know this sounds heartless but this is my only refuge other than crippling depression and hopelessness. Once during a particularly bad period I came across this article I wish I could punch the person who wrote this in the face. I don't want to suffer needlessly out of some sense of virtue .

If there is, then we would all deserve to go to hell for creating such a destructive system in the first place and I will scream at said entity for placing all of us in a test with objectives both poorly defined and borderline impossible to meet. Things are going off a cliff and I intend to laugh on the way down and shoot myself before we hit the ground.

In my opinion, the North Korean leadership has simply contented itself with survival rather than unifying Korea under their flag. They have realized that any of their dick waving defensive measures would be temporary at best, and have decided to prioritize diplomacy. On its face, this seems like good news, and in any comment section concerning this you will find plenty of people praising the apparent modernization of the DPRK.

The truth is, I'm trying to develop an opinion on this topic, but I'm required to take a stance, so I am doing just that. Please feel free to correct me if I use the wrong language e.g. is it still appropriate to use the term sex change operation ? . So, the idea of transitioning makes sense to me as a treatment for a mental disorder that disorder being that you don't identify as the biological sex that you are. Basically, being transgender is a mental disorder. One can parse words and say, no, it's not being transgender that is the mental disorder, it is having body dysphoria that is the mental disorder. I don't get the distinction a transgender person has body dysphoria because he or she is transgender i.e. he feels like a she or she feels like a he . So, transgender is a mental disorder and there are essentially two ways to treat it. First, you can work on the mind to help the person accept the biological fact that they are the sex they were born into. Second, you can work on the body to help it match the sex the person identifies with, even if it's not the person's actual biological sex. My understanding is that the first method has proved more successful in treating the disorder, since most transgender people are unable to fully accept their biological sex. So, here are my litany of stances I will take that I'm hoping you can help me work through. 1 We have to acknowledge transgenderism is a mental disorder to get to the conclusion that transitioning can ever be a medically necessary thing as opposed to just voluntary plastic surgery like a boob job or rhinoplasty for strictly cosmetic purposes . 2 If we acknowledge transgenderism is a mental disorder, we have to conclude that mental health has failed us in treating transgenderism since the best solution is to give in to the disorder. It's similar to saying, Bob thinks he is Jesus and we don't know how to convince him otherwise, so we'll all agree to treat him as Jesus. 3 Treatment by giving in to the disorder imposes upon everybody else. Not only do we allow the Transgender person to give into the disorder, but now we all have to give into that person's disorder by treating them as a different sex than he or she actually is. 4 The mental health community should really try to work on this to find a mental, rather than physical, treatment. The benefit of a mental treatment is that it would be ongoing. The physical treatment of transition is permanent and if it turns out not to work out it cannot simply be modified or swapped out for a different approach. EDIT I see trans issues are a big thing in  right now. I interpret this as a good thing there is a lot of confusion when it comes to Trans issues and people are trying to figure it out.

Minorities were herded into these communities which were significantly poorer. However, I don't entirely believe the system is still rigged against minorities. The cycle of poverty still exists in these communities due to a combination of factors poor family management, poor facilities which exist due to the nature of the birth of these poor communities, peer pressure of youths to resort to crime, high crime rates. I feel as though a minority child has the same ability to succeed and strive for greatness however it is the negative influences of the community which stem this growth. I think it would be unfair to blame an inherently racist police force for this as I believe the disproportionate crime rates in poorer minority communities stems from the aforementioned issues. Its not that the police are specifically seeking out minority offenders but rather that the crime committed by such are more visible, prolific and easier to be tackled than white collar crimes. The high crime rates leads to more officers, more officers lead to further tension, this tension leads to violence in the community and the saddening occasionally fatal exchanges with police. I may be taking a rose tinted view but I believe a law abiding, hard working citizen can make it regardless of colour or race but to some extent the community is holding itself back, in some ways due to the racism of the past and in others due to the negative criminal influences in some areas of the community. Now I must highlight I am in NO WAY denying a disparity in the lives of minorities compared to whites in America, I am rather stating that this disparity is as a result of the overt segregation and racism of the past which has led to this cycle of poverty in minority communities. I in no way mean to generalise and am truly sorry if it seems I have done so or have caused ant offense. I'm an outsider from the UK and maybe I'm overly optimistic I just don't believe or maybe don't want to that the system as a whole discriminates by race, but rather is attempting and failing somewhat to mend the wounds of a disgusting and inhumane system.

Note Indie games with pixelated unique graphics is a different story. I'm talking about mainly people who are comparing old graphics to new graphics. Edit here Clarification on this. There's a distinction to be made between good looking yet not photorealistic stylized graphics like Borderlands 2 and graphics that are dated low polygon low quality because of worse hardware software. I believe caring about graphics is completely reasonable. Because of a standard being created over the years for graphical quality, it's normal to be adjusted to the more realistic look of a game, and that makes it harder to thoroughly enjoy a game which is graphically inferior. Not to say these games are unenjoyable but they're much harder to get into if that makes sense. Like when people watch TV shows like the Walking Dead vs. a cartoon like Spongebob, there is an inherently different reaction because of the difference in realism between the characters. Obviously there's a big difference between the focus of these shows Spongebob is a children's comedy, Walking Dead is a thriller post apocalyptic zombie show but the point still stands that you don't look at these characters in the same way. One is modeled off of real life with real people, another is an animation. So when players get accustomed to a certain graphical quality of video games, it's not unreasonable for them to get less enjoyment out of previous less graphically intensive games. Just as a side example, I've been playing Fallout 4 lately which looks pretty good for the most part, and then today I tried going back and playing a little bit of Fallout New Vegas and I found it very difficult for myself to get truly interested in the game because of how comparatively bad it looks. It's very offputting and distracting to downgrade like that. Even games like Red Dead Redemption and L.A. Noire which were arguably some of the most graphically beautiful games at the time look a little dated now. Not that the games are bad, but when a game isn't up to today's graphical standards, it really is more difficult to get into in the same way you can with modern games. Now I'm not saying I know for sure that this is how every gamer thinks, or if it is even representative of many gamers at all. But I think a lot of people at least in my experience who claim graphics don't matter just kid themselves into thinking like they're from the year it came out. I see arguments about how shit the new Battlefront is compared to Battlefront 2 and when the topic of graphics comes up everyone says Look how beautiful that game was And it was made in 2005 Yeah? How does that discredit the new Battlefront from being arguably one of the best looking games on the market right now? More importantly, 2005 was 11 years ago, and a game that was beautiful in 2005 looks as good, if not worse, than browser games mobile apps now. Anybody who thinks they'd take those graphics in favor of better gameplay nowadays is kidding themselves or insane. Not only that but there doesn't have to be a tradeoff of gameplay and graphics. There seems to be this argument that hmph well I care about gameplay not graphics. Why? Why does the visual of a video game not matter to you whatsoever, and why does good graphics somehow have to be traded for better gameplay? There is nothing wrong shallow with having a graphical expectation on a video game in the same way that we have a gameplay expecation. Just like we expect something better than a basic sidescroller in 2016, we should also expect something better looking than an SNES game in 2016. Not brush it off and pretend graphics don't matter. Graphics and atomosphere feel created by the graphics are just important to producing quality and memorable gameplay as the actual features of the game. . Note Just want to reiterate, I am excluding Indie titles from this. While I guess I could include them, Indie titles are usually cheap, played for fun, and people go into them with a different mindset than AAA titles which allows a little more leniency with graphics."}, {"conclusion": "Many countries allow gay men to donate with no deferral which proves it is safe.", "id": 18585, "argument": "Since the UK has dropped its wait time to 3 months, other nations should consider following suit.

It helps encourage the political process. But specifically, in my home state of Florida, under the current system this would NOT be a good idea, for one main reason. In Florida, the voter roll is public information. Anyone can request a disk containing the entire voter roll including names, addresses, birthdays, mailing addresses, gender, race, etc. for free. There are several sites that offer searchable databases of this data. Even if you could get your data off these sites some sites refuse to take stuff down , you also would have to file an exemption request to get it off government records. The only options available to a common citizen are Victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence. Official verification of the crime is required Certified Participant in Address Confidentiality Program only for victims of domestic violence You cannot simply request an exemption just because you want to be anonymous, or because you are afraid of a person who hasn't committed a specific provable crime against you. With automatic voter registration, we'd be putting a large amount of personal information in a public database, most likely without the knowledge of those being registered. This is a massive breach of privacy and can be a danger to society. As this is automatic, this database will begin to look more and more like a database of the names and addresses of the majority of Floridians. A white supremacist could use the database to target ethnic minorities, as race is included in the database A person could use the information in the database to possibly commit identity theft A person could be stalked using the information in the database A victim of a crime, such as rape, that they did not report or that could not be prosecuted, could be found by their abuser A person of general popularity, such as an internet celebrity, could be doxxed Quite simply, Florida needs the way it handles its citizens' personal data before implementing automatic voter registration. x200B TL DR My argument is that we should remove Florida's voter roll from the public sphere before implementing automatic voter registration.

I just feel as though so many jobs include doing something for money that you otherwise would be against and am overly skeptical of management's motives for how they run their business, and can't just do the work and be happy to have a paycheck. For example, working in a tech support at a call center. The person calls, you fix their problem, and that should be it. But supervisors grade your performance based off of whether you transitions to a sales oppurtunity. Well, my job is tech support, not sales So why am I graded on sales? So in this environment, there's no way to succeed unless I am shaped the way they want, and if I don't conform than im out a job. Doesn't matter how well you are at providing tech support, if you don't meet this one mark consistently, your gone. So wouldn't the right thing to do be to just realize that they make the rules, and i'm just an employee and if that is how they choose to run things, I should conform or get a new job.

So first off the twitch streamers name is \u201cKarupups\u201d and she is a cosplayer from Russia. She wanted to cosplay as Lifeline from the game Apex Legends which is a black character. Her being white she make ups her face and body black. This is why I don\u2019t think it was racist Her attentions weren\u2019t to mock black people in the first place. Many people in the Cosplay community commonly paint their body and face different colours to match the character they\u2019re Cosplaying as. Blue, green, brown, etc. This makes them seem like the actual character. Being from Russia it\u2019s common to not understand \u201cblackfacing\u201d as it\u2019s more of a North American thing. When she make ups her body black her attention are to be more like the character. I know this because she even goes in great detail with the tattoo on her shoulder. It is just like the in game character and clearly she put time into it. proving she wasn\u2019t just being black to mock. Nobody told her that what she was doing was wrong and no one thought what she was doing was wrong her viewership is Russian Ukraine it wasn\u2019t until someone pointed out what she was doing was wrong when the accusations started. Black facing is a recently changed term that hasn\u2019t caught spread to other places yet. Blackfacing was originally to make fun of a person of colour for how they look by mocking their blackness while reenacting racist stereotypes or slurs but recently changed to trying to look anything like a black person just to look \u201cdarker\u201d for aesthetic styling reasoning. The changed term is most common in South West Asia, Africa and North America. While most other places like in Europe still considers Black facing to the original way. Why I think it was wrong She was banned for 30 days for doing something she didn\u2019t understand was wrong. She was going to go to streamfest kinda like twitchcon at the end of April and already had it planned but there would be no reason to go now because of the hate. This basically ruined her career in one stream. Common misunderstandings \u201cShe didn\u2019t need to paint her face\u201d You are correct but like I said this is common so cosplayers can get into character. If you were cosplaying a sunflower. Painting your face yellow would improve your sunflowerness. \u201cJust because she didn\u2019t say anything racist doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have racist attentions\u201d Correct But I would also be correct to say she didn\u2019t say anything to prove it was racist attentions. Besides the argument. \u201cblackfacing is racist so this is racist. She did a really bad job as well proving it was racist\u201d Well that\u2019s why I want my mind changed. You can\u2019t just say it\u2019s racist because in your country and in your mind set it\u2019s racist. Also no one said she was good at cosplaying. She does it in her spare time. Just because she\u2019s bad at makeup didn\u2019t mean she meant black people look bad. WHY I AM WRITING THIS I just want to state IN NO WAY am I racist. I am a EQUALIST that stands up for ANY kind of non equality arguments. This female didn\u2019t deserve to loose her job for something she didn\u2019t understand is my argument. But I am willing to change my view on it if someone can help me understand the racism behind it.

For instance, I work as a graphic designer, and while perhaps I could claim that I am being hired for less than I am worth, and my work is being exploited perhaps I could gain the same freelance that only holds true if I ignore other factors of production the computer I work on, software I use, training received, purchase of business level goods to optimise workflow, the building I work in etc. If profit is held to be ONLY the surplus value of an employee, it ignores the fact that entrepreneurs invest in these capital goods a long time sometimes years prior to the selling of said product. The business must be able to manage the risk from investing that may never eventuate in a successful product.

I know it's a waste of time, but so are a million things, for example, Reddit, 80 of Reddit at least, some people use Reddit to learn stuff or meet people. Watching porn and masturbating isn't unhealthy unless you're addicted to porn, and not watching porn won't immediately make you sociable or good looking. I'll admit, I'm a very pragmatic person, I don't masturbate all that much, and when I do is because being horny makes me unfocused on my work. I'm also not very social and hate most people around me but I do have sex weekly, so I'll admit I don't get horny all that much, at least compared to people who feel the biological need to have sex. That said, the time you spent masturbating, while it may vary, I don't think goes over over 20 minutes, maybe 30. If you seriously take an entire hour to cum every time you masturbate you're trying too hard to be the nice guy who finish last. So from a non productive stand, it's really stupid, you can also save time by not going to the bathroom when you want to shit and wait until you also want to take a piss, so that you save time. Yeah, it's just as stupid, you waste as much time and focus fighting the urge as actually going to the bathroom and masturbating. It applies to both examples Now, there's another side to it, the other argument I see a lot on that subreddit is Oh, I feel pathetic after masturbating, don't you feel pathetic after masturbating, alone? In your room that your mother paid for? It's like these people have some humiliation fetish. I feel like someone who rather stay at home making music that someone who needs to go out and get wasted to have sex. Masturbating is a quick way to regain focus when I'm feeling horny. But no, instead of dealing with the psychological issues you have with yourself, that you feel the need to go the gym and not masturbate to re assure yourself that you're not a loser and that you think that not being able to have sex because you have poor social excuses is bad only because you're a virgin and not because you have poor social skills, they choose to ignore this and just avoid the thing that triggers this response. It's stupid. So much so, that the top post on that subreddit is someone complaining on how stupid it is. I know this came off as ranty and that I touched on many points, but I had to go trough everything as NoFap implies many things and I'm sure many people who don't masturbate aren't in neither of those two categories The pragmatic one and the one that feels like a loser . I'm just here to have a fun discussion, because I just can't for the life of me understand how people think not watching porn is effective as solving any of the two issues they are pointing at Wasting time and again, feeling like a loser .

As i understand, its very similar to the US. I am libertarian. My understanding of left wing politics is as follows I have always imagined that those that vote for left wing parties do so because they believe in equality between the classes of people. Greater access to education, healthcare and welfare for low income earners are the most prominent issues in leftist politics. All of this is underwritten by an ideal that society is responsible for maintaining a basic level of human welfare for all people, regardless of how poor they are. This is my problem. As a citizen of a wealthy western society, I feel as though the majority of those classified as The Poor in my country already live like kings compared to those in developing countries. As such, I believe that the people that truly champion the leftist cause should be calling for my nations resources to be diverted to the truly downtrodden in the world the Africas, selected Middle Eastern countries, South East Asia etc. This also touches upon the issue of fair trade.

Please tell me im missing something. im not unreasonable. I can understand that without government programs, there would be many more people in my country in dire straits. this is actually an argument that somewhat hinges upon the primacy of Keynesian economics and intervention, but i will preemptively concede this point to focus more on the ethical side of things . TLDR The Left of my country say that all people deserve X level of welfare, but prioritise the welfare of our own citizens over those of others. I believe some quantum leaps in logic are afoot here. . EDIT I am aware there may be some people that make every effort to abide by what i consider proper read hard line socialist policy in my country. I refer to the majority that lets be honest probably do not. EDIT1 Many of you are arguing that there is no reason why my country should not help the needy citizens within our own shores. My problem is, considering the world as a whole, I remain unconvinced that such needy people exist in my country. The issue is one of scale. As ranked at 11 to 8 in GDP per capita in 2012, its is actually really really hard to find an Australian that is so impoverished. They certainly exist the native population in certain far rural areas live in absolute squalor. You would struggle, however, to name a group that receives more ethnic based support than these people. To the extent that it is common to condescendingly believe that they are a lost cause. My point is that an overwhelming portion of the Australian population already lives well above what is considered subsistence level. I observe that we have reached that point where we ought to direct marginal efforts to foreign aid if we are truly concerned with being egalitarian. But instead people of my country are now arguing over funding for next generation fibre optic satellite internet. A bit hard to make the argument that my people need more help in the face of that. EDIT2 Concerning foreign intervention If im truly to believe that all human beings are entitled to some basic level of subsistence, I should be responsible for raising up all human beings to that level at a concurrent rate. Doing otherwise inadvertently promotes inequality. I must exhaust all efforts to this end up to and including pressuring and intervention in another sovereign nation. As I am subject to my government intervening in my own personal affairs occasionally against my will occasionally not , why should my government not intervene in the affairs of other peoples against their will? In for a penny, in for a pound. I do not believe that the legitimacy of government is constrained by oceans. It is constrained by the fundamental legitimacy of intervention. I feel if the Left is unprepared to make such a commitment and i understand, this is particularly onerous , then they shouldn't really be advertising that they champion the cause of true equality. It should be made abundantly clear that they instead are for equality amongst our own people and not of others.

Apparently, a prostate orgasm is even better than a penile orgasm, though in a different way, as it's more intense, lasts longer and there's no refractory period. On top of that, there are loads of men that enjoy anal with women, so surely the physical sensation of anal with another man physically feels just as good. Men have the same sexual equipment too so blowjobs and handjobs are probably going to feel physically better. Also, as an extra, as a group, men have a higher sex drive too, so they're probably more likely to match each other in desire for sex. It just makes sense that men would come from having sex with other men if they were just open to it.

Welfare benefits are something I am torn up about ATM I believe that in our society, wealth will always exist in a bell curve There will always be people who are in the below average zone regardless. So my understanding of welfare policy is that it is societies responsibility to assist this persistent class.

He was making ~10 dollars and hour and received several benefits including food stamps medical coverage ect. He then was promoted to bakery manager and given ~14 dollars and hour and full time. After his promotion he lost the food stamps insurance went up other benefits stopped. All things said and done they are financially in the same situation cash available as they were before. Despite him being successful. Now she is pregnant again. And when that baby comes, benefits will come back. He recently took a job offer for a part time role at a hardware for ~10 dollars and hour.

Truly radical empiricism strips away beliefs of all kinds, leaving you with only the qualia, or raw feels , on which beliefs of all kinds are based. Popular idealist philosopher Bernardo Kastrup quotes Andrei Linde on this to my mind semi truism gt Let us remember that our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but with perceptions. Later we find out that our perceptions obey some laws, which can be most conveniently formulated if we assume that there is some underlying reality beyond our perceptions. This model of material world obeying laws of physics is so successful that soon we forget about our starting point and say that matter is the only reality, and perceptions are only helpful for its description. This assumption is almost as natural and maybe as false as our previous assumption that space is only a mathematical tool for the description of matter. ARGUMENT 2 Consciousness is already and always nondual. By nondual I mean not divided into subject and object . You may think that you are a subject who has consciousness, as if it's an attribute you can lose or gain, but I say that what's really going on is that you ARE consciousness with various thoughts and beliefs and sensations floating around in you and what is a thought belief sensation made of? Consciousness. Examples you may have a feeling of localisation or contraction in your head or chest as you read this and you think that's you , empirical evidence of your separate status as a subject who possesses consciousness, with a world outside consciousness beginning just outside your skin or possibly brain and continuing until it reaches the next person's skin or possibly brain but I say that if we break this apprehension down strictly into its empirical components, it all dissolves into nondual consciousness. The localisation or contraction in the head or chest is just a feeling, the bodily sensations and ideas about the body are just sensations and ideas, the visual experience or thought of endless 360 horizons is just a visual experience or thought, and the thought that other people's consciousness is different from yours is just a thought. About solipsism well, at the very least, I can guarantee solipsism is NOT the case for you. I do admit that the tendency toward the absurd conclusion of solipsism is a problem for monistic idealism nonduality, though, just as the tendency toward the absurd conclusion of eliminative materialism there is no consciousness is a problem for materialism. I remain agnostic about why your thoughts and mine are not apprehended from a single point of view. A popular nondual teacher Francis Lucille points out that your awareness of what you were doing ten years ago at some exact time is not recoverable by you right now, and it may be similar across minds the you of your name cannot know what the you of my name is thinking right now. I don't claim to know how this works, all I claim is that a rigorous empirical examination of your experience, right now, will reveal that all you can find is nondual consciousness, and I can say the same. So, we may be different lumps of it, or lenses refracting it. I don't know. But think of the most personal, unique thing about you maybe it's a childhood memory or an unusal belief, a sort of psychic birthmark. Whatever it is and please go ahead and summon it to mind before continuing , notice that it appears IN CONSCIOUSNESS. That's where you saw it just now, like a diamond set in black velvet. The velvet is the universal, interchangeable backing to every diamond that exists and, AFAICT, every diamond that could exist. Just as all your innermost thoughts and feelings appear in consciousness, so do mine. What could differentiate your consciousness from mine, other than its contents? If everything you were aware of was swapped with everything I'm aware of, neither of us could tell the difference because what we really are is the consciousness itself, not the perturbations of it thoughts feelings sensations we usually identify with instead."}, {"conclusion": "Universities in the past have found it difficult to go green with their policies.", "id": 122150, "argument": "It is the fourth year that the league ranking institutions by environmental and ethical performance, has recorded fewer universities on course to meet their legally binding target of reducing emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2020."}, {"conclusion": "All UN members can vote on ICC definition of \"aggression\"", "id": 135128, "argument": "\"U.S. Policy Regarding the International Criminal Court\".

I disagree. Let me start with racist whites do exist. There are Whites who hate all black people, no matter how proper or educated, no matter if they are native or immigrant Black as long as the person has that skin color, there is an inherent hate there. That\u2019s what I classify as racism, and is completely unacceptable and immoral. But these type of Whites are in the minority. Most Whites have at least one black friend, which shows most are at least open minded to being around a person of color. Most Whites are not afraid of rich African Americans. Most Whites aren\u2019t afraid of your regular properly speaking middle class African American. They are afraid of African Americans who conform to \u201cghetto culture.\u201d By ghetto culture\u201d I mean ebonics speaking, pants sagging, constantly fighting, cursing in every other sentence, dressed down, \u201chood\u201d that may or not come with rudeness, aggressively and lack of manners. But if a White person says I don\u2019t want to be around an African American who embodies or personifies ghetto culture, they are classified as racist. But take this When I was in college I met a girl who was Nigerian and had immigrated from as a child from Nigeria. This girl would go on and on about how she hated ghetto American blacks. She complained about how they could barely speak proper English, were violent, didn't value education they way Nigerians did, etc.\u201d If she sensed an American black person was \u201cghetto , she would not want to be around them. Apparently, this is a common sentiment in certain Black immigrant groups from Africa and the Caribbean. They have no problems with your average African American. But refuse to associate with nor want their children to date marry an African American who they perceive are \u201cghetto\u201d or \u201chood\u201d. This is shocking because you wouldn\u2019t think one Black group would be negative about another group of the African diaspora who shares similar struggles in America. Most importantly, if a White person said the same thing, they would be classified as a racist. That\u2019s when I started realizing that if both Whites and Black immigrants feel this way, the problem can\u2019t be racism. It\u2019s classism and aversion to certain behavior that is associated with \u201cLower class behavior.\u201d It\u2019s very similar to how middle class White people are afraid of poor Whites. I am not condoning classism. I think it\u2019s a facet in America that needs to be dealt with, especially since it impacts the historically disadvantage minority groups the most. But if that is the problem, then that is how we should address the problems so we can become an integrated society. I understand this is a difficult topic to speak about. But this is something that really blew my mind and made me think. I put this on , because if there is a bigger picture I am missing or if there is an erroneous assumption I made with how I came to the conclusion about classism not racism hypothesis, then we should speak about it and educate others on it.

Back then it was sooo good it had excellent writing, brilliant anti authority satire on family values as it began with Married with Children showing families weren't all perfect, anti hollywood satire, relatable characters you gave a damn about, actual emotion, heart and soul like Mother Simpson which moved me when i was 13, characters with a sense of humanity, sarcastic snarky wit and excellent humor, memorable episodes with stuff and quotes you won't forget and proper use of celebrity guest stars. x200B When season 11 came along as the show started to decline i didn't mind a few episodes but i feel Behind The Laughter would had been the PERFECT series finale as it was a well done episode and i felt it went off the air in May 2000 in my mind. Then when season 12 came, the show became a very different animal than The Simpsons which ended in my mind with Behind the Laughter. anything past that is NOT The Simpsons but a program that bills itself as The Simpsons. It is not The Simpsons. That show, the landmark piece of American culture that debuted on 17 December 1989, went off the air more than a decade ago in May 2000. The replacement is a hopelessly mediocre imitation that bears only a superficial resemblance to the original. It is the unwanted sequel, the stale spinoff, the creative dry hole that is kept pumping in the endless search for more money. It is Zombie Simpsons. x200B Except Fox just won't let it go and this show is too much of a product of it's time the 90s yet the old episodes to Behind hold up to this day showing how much creativity they use to have with this show back then and how special it was. The ratings have declined more and more over the years. I noticed in late 2000 and 2001 that something was wrong with this show as the characters didn't act like the ones i know and the writing was rather crappy and no longer satire. x200B I stopped watching the show in 2003 as it was getting stale and ran out of storylines ideas even when the good writers left the show and when Phil Hartman died. No longer was it an anti authority anti hollywood satire with heart, soul, emotion, wit, intelligence, humanity and well timed sarcastic humor, it became a soulless shambling undead creature husk of itself former self. that should be shot in the head so it won't shuffle around anymore searching for new life. I moved on to other adult cartoons. x200B Yet i'm so glad King of the Hill, Futurama, Regular Show, Gravity Falls etc. ended on good notes and soon My Little Pony Friendship is Magic as it's better to end on a good note then become a shambling zombiefied husk like The Simpsons became. x200B The closet thing to a modern day The Simpsons is Bojack Horseman which has the same anti hollywood satire, soul, heart, intelligent well written storylines, maturity and all that which is something missing from Zombie Simpsons.

Wanting a dog with a specific personality need a specific breed for a specific job Disposition and manners are going to have a lot more to do with upbringing, imo, than species. Obviously that's a generalization, as something like energy level cannot be trained out of a dog. But it's pretty easy to gauge things like that in a dog whose bloodline you don't know by just hanging out with them a little terrier shepherd looking dogs that are bouncing off the walls are probably going to be high energy. That doesn't require a pedigree to determine. Similarly, I can't think of a reason why a service dog would need to be 100 of a specific breed. Looking for a general type of dog makes sense, but why you would need a purebred lab and couldn't make do with a lab x from a shelter is beyond me.

Not all of them, obviously, but not all purebred dogs are cut out to be police service drug dogs either.

Specific breeds were created by man, and it's cruel and unnecessary to inbreed them to the point of mental and physical illness for the purpose of maintaining some man made breed standard.

I have seen many of my friends get extended time in my school who I truly believe did not need it and they did so just so that they could receive extended time when it came time for them to take the SAT and ACT. If everyone had more time to take the test, I think that everyone would be able to think through the questions more thoroughly and would be able to receive higher scores than they are currently receiving. The people that get extended time, but do not actually need it are at an advantage. They have figured out how to work the system in order to get their desired scores. However, they do not take the test under the same conditions as people without extended time, therefore, standardized tests are not actually assessing everyone under equal circumstances. Additionally, there are people that get tutored multiple times per week, or even once a week, and they learn strategies and take countless practice tests in order to raise their scores. I was one of these people and I do believe that we are also at an advantage over the rest of the population that does not get extended time or cannot afford a tutor.

While it is unlikely that many people in modern societies would actually agree with the absurd ideas listed above, many people in first world countries still believe in the general religions and also believes that the books which hold these ideas are sacred. People venerate, for example, the bible as some sort of moral baseline, something that everyone should try to strive for. While people may cherrypick the good parts of their religious texts and use those as justification for their religious morality, doing this also indirectly legitimizes the religious extremists. If modern society as an overall whole venerates their religious texts as morally pure, then this also venerates the horrendous parts of those religious texts, the slavery, execution, mistreatment of women, are all legitimized whenever someone calls the bible a moral imperative. Even if people from modern society don't follow these wretched ideas, this will simply be seen as an of hypocrisy from the extremists from the perspective of the extremists, it looks as if the moderate theists realize that the stonings for religious heresy are morally sound, but are simply too hypocritical to go through with them. Some moderates may argue that those parts of the their religious texts don't count any more and claim that they are instead metaphorical or that they were simply mistranslated. The metaphorical argument is demonstrably false as the context of the more horrendous statements are that of a list of rules, stating what a good society should and should not do. As for the mistranslated argument, if you have an objective method in which to identify which parts of your religious text is mistranslated and which parts are not, then please present this if you do not have an objective way to determine which parts of your religious text are and are not translated and that you are arbitrarily declaring any part of the religion that you do not like as mistranslated, then you cannot consistently follow your religion you cannot look at a contract and sign it while agreeing to follow only half of the things on it. Furthermore, if you cannot tell which parts of your religion are and are not translated incorrectly and claim that some parts are translated incorrectly, then there is no reason to follow that religion at all, as you have no way of knowing which parts are the holy words of your god and which parts are fabricated by men.

Many people argue that circumcision is a good choice because they believe it is easier to clean, less prone to infection, in accordance with their religious views, and by choosing to remove the foreskin when the individual is extremely young the parent is making sure that the individual will not remember the painful and possibly traumatic experience later on in life. Other people disagree with circumcision. They say that since the individual can have no say in the matter when they are an infant, the parents have no right to make the decision for them. People have argued that there is no evidence which supports a circumcised penis is easier to clean or less prone than infection. Some argue that circumcision reduces the individual's experience of sexual pleasure their opponents respond that this will only occur in botched circumcisions, others say that since pleasure is a subjective experience there is absolutely no logical way to compare the pleasure someone circumcised derives from sex compared to a non circumcised individual . Let me put all of these arguments aside for a moment. My concern is not the legitimacy of any of the beliefs or statements above, it is the following There are people who argue that infants should continue to be circumcised because personally they find circumcised penises more appealing or sexually satisfying. If you think about it, they are discussing what happens to an infant in terms of their own adult sexual pleasure and preferences . They are saying they would not find the child sexually appealing without circumcision. The individuals they are talking about will not be old enough any time soon to have legal and consenting sex with them, so to discuss what happens to them as if it somehow affects their sexual preferences is to say Things happening to an infant child's genitals affect my sex life . To talk about what happens to a child's genitals in terms of your own sexuality is nothing less than severe internalized pedophilia. I say this as someone who personally finds a circumcised penis more attractive and sexually pleasurable than an un circumcised one.

It's not even close, African Americans, as bum a rap as they get in a lot of ways in the US, are way better off than their African cousins. Life expectancy is longer, income is higher, there's better access to food, water, shelter, even for the poorest African Americans. There's basically no metric by which Africans are better off than blacks in the US. It's not as though, if not for the slave trade, Africa would be in great shape. Sure, it might be a little better, but there still would've been hundreds of years of colonialism stamping it down. Would 12 million additional people the number kidnapped and brought over here really have made that much of a difference in the long run? Would anywhere in West Africa be a place that, after living in the West, you'd want to go raise a daughter? The 40 million or so blacks in America are the 1 . In exchange for a couple hundred years of utterly brutal, vicious slavery in the United States, they're so much better off than their African counterparts that I think that the only rational conclusion is that they're the real winners of the Atlantic slave trade.

Usually this is because most porn portrays scenarios that are degrading to women, objectify women, show men in dominant roles or women in submissive roles. This unequal showing of men or women in porn has been decried by a lot of people and has been protested against. I do not deny the existence of this inequality in most of porn's representation of women men, but I think it has little or nothing to do with any group wishing to reduce the status of women or otherwise negatively impact women in society. In other words, I don't believe mysogyny among porn creators is the cause for the unequal representation of different genders in porn. I could see an argument that mysogyny among the consumers of porn may lead to this, but there are plenty of men who treat women fairly but are nonetheless aroused satisfied by this kind of porn. The major reasons a lot of these groups care is because they are concerned about moral issues or that viewing such porn will influence the way people act particular men towards women such as objectifying them or being violent towards them. Whether or not this is true, if people want the apparently sexist representation of women and men in porn to change, the way to do it is through shifting the demand for it. Most consumers of porn are men, and the porn industry subsequently earns most of its money apparently a 5 billion year industry from those men. Companies that make porn are naturally going to produce whatever sells the most. Many men will be aroused satisfied by porn that show attractive, uncommonly built women doing stuff that they'd want done for to them. Thus they produce porn of girls with big boobs giving blowjobs and having threesomes while seeming eager to please and doing the man's bidding and tons of other stuff . Because it makes more money that way. Sure they can show female dominance, male submission, or fully equal roles and such porn is produced. However it is the minority of porn because the demand and the money lies with men paying to watch a uncommonly built females doing uncommon things. I'm not actually judging if this inequality is a good or a bad thing in itself. I do, however, think that this happens not because of mysogyny but because of the demand of their consumers. I also think that a change in demand is the most practical and only realistic way to change it. Since porn is typically used privately, and is often indulging in a fantasy, I think it's not likely to change the demand of the men that use it but if it was changed, then that'd be one way to do it. Alternatively women or other gender groups or sexual orientations just using the larger groups, don't mean to exclude anyone could increase demand for other forms of pornography that would give the porn industry incentive to change. Since we now have the internet, its unrealistic to expect that porn will ever go away, so I see protests as ineffective and impractical.

With Ana added she is the only 1 out of 5 support heroes that has no heal at all. Blizzard has changed the the team tooltip to say no healers instead of no support heroes. The categories exist to guide players about the role of a hero and I think changing this tooltip around a single hero just shows that the hero is misclassified. Symmetra is much more useful on defense than on offense. Her turrets are much more useful on a defensive position. Her ult isn't very useful when attacking on a payload escort mission. While other supports are better in certain situations Symmetra's weakness on attack seems larger than the weakness of other support heroes in certain situations. Meanwhile, she shines on defense. Her turrets can alert you of incoming flankers and eliminate them or weaken them and while her ult is up it is much easier to hold the point as eliminations only last a few seconds. Symmetra is also incredibly similar to the defense hero Torbjorn. His E gives armor and hers gives shields. Both have shift turrets. Both have relatively weak primary weapons with an alt fire. The only counterarguments I could see would be her shields, which are similar to Torb's armor, and her teleporter. While the teleporter is almost akin to Resurrection and it is charged quite quickly I don't think it's enough to consider her a support. It is also much easier to establish and defend on defense. TLDR Only support with no heal Much better defender than attacker Very similar to defense hero Torbjorn Also disclaimer I am not mad about this, it doesn't really matter.

Whether it be in general discussion or perhaps academic discourse, there are often attempts to advocate for free will on the basis that it's implications are desirable. The following examples are pragmatic approaches that illustrate this. Free will allows us to punish and reward others This reasoning is justified on the basis that the opposite of libertarianism, which is determinism, renders the notion of punishment and reward nullified on the basis that we have no control over our actions, which according to determinists are preordained by prior causation. Therefore, in order to retain the ability to punish and reward others let us presume this is desirable for the sake of debate we must accept libertarianism. I will reject this through the following lines of reasoning The implications of an argument should not determine a positions epistemological truth. It assumes that the conduct of our day to day life should be or is, governed by a heightened sense of philosophical reasoning, it isn't and if it were, life would become undoubtedly bleak and lame. For example, if a determinists' house were broken into and his prized possessions stolen from him, no one would fault the determinist for cursing the robber. No one would say, ah but look, the robber was actually determined to do this, he has a biological propensity to commit crime and grew up in an impoverished area. So really, you have no justification to be upset . This just simply isn't a mandate we should would hold our fellow man to. Regardless of this happening, the determinist can still derive pleasure and or catharsis from being upset at both his misfortune and grievances direct towards the robber. Just because he advocates for a deterministic world view, doesn't mean he can switch his innate human responses on and off. Another example would be christmas. People can relish Christmas festivity whilst maintaining that none of it has any real grounding in empirical truth. The same principal applies here, people are engaging in a practise that might not necessarily align with their world view, but it doesn't matter. Because the inconsistency isn't a big deal, is victimless, and provides joy to the individual. In short, we can still maintain, to a small and victimless extent, notions of punishment and reward, whilst advocating for determinism. Not being able to punish others might not be as terrible as we might think. More rehabilitative approaches to punishment have proved entirely successful. And jailing people would simply be done on the basis of not wanting them to recommit a crime. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

You have a bunch of people on one side pretending like they have any clue about how climate science works and then belittling the other side for saying this shit is confusing I don't believe it. This is fueled by a president who believes in conspiracy theories and thinks cold weather disproves global warming, but also grotesquely over exaggeration and political manipulation of scientific reports. All this has combined to turn science into a political weapon thrown around with no concern about how it affects our society. It disgusts me when Trump says he doesn't believe scientists, it also disgusts me when AOC says we have 12 years left to live. The reality is most people do not understand climate change and are just throwing their hats into a ring they have no business pretending to be knowledgable about. What we have here is a marketing issue. Marketing is used to sell a product. The type of marketing that is used in politics is usually full of rhetoric and over exaggeration. How can you belittle someone for being skeptical that if we don't sink 100s of trillions of dollars into green energy that is still not nearly as efficient as fossil fuels, that the Earth will be saved from some doomsday scenario? On the flip side, How are do you sit there and flat out deny scientific consensus? Well, it's simple most people aren't climate scientists which is fine. The thing is doomsday scenarios may be the most exciting way to engage public interest, but it is extremely toxic. Yes, there is a scientific consensus that we are speeding up climate change, but the no turning back point is very much up for debate. We have had the worst weather in decades but it's still not the worst weather we have had. The drought in the 1930's is a good example. So using natural disasters to create fear and drive politics is highly immoral. I think the back and forth about weather severity and what it means is beside the point. We need to sell people on what is more tangible and what they can understand which is . In reality regardless, of what you believe, it is pretty obvious that a future with renewable energy is a much brighter one. I love this video about the third industrial revolution The thing is switching over to renewable energy and redoing our energy infrastructure will create so many jobs. On top of that, you don't want to be the country playing catch up. Why on Earth would we not want to be at the forefront of renewable technology when the trend starts completely switching in that direction. Like many things in politics, we have just ended up talking past each other. Let's stop arguing about something that no one actually understands, and start talking about how green technology is going to become one of the largest industries in our future. Right now innovation is being halted by rhetoric, and scientists need to stop using politics to advertise untenable predictions and start showing why everyone should be stoked about a clean future. x200B"}, {"conclusion": "Paying for content with money instead of attention to ads can be preferable for people in some cases.", "id": 35200, "argument": "Some readers may prefer to support a publication directly to avoid distracting or misleading ads being placed alongside the journalism.

Then one day I started exploring the possibility of intelligent life within the stars. I knew it was there by simple logic but I explored the possibility of it already being here, among us, reachable. I began exploring this possibility through diving into a moment of insanity by trying to telepathically reach extraterrestrials by simply calling with my mind. After my attempts, I began to get overwhelming and unexplainable sensations Painless yet potent magnetic like pressures in my forehead and upper head and sudden feelings of orgasmic like pleasure vibrating down my body. Random lights started streaking across the sky. Through a course of a few months, I began seeing dense golden sparks of light in windows in various places sporadically as if the phenoma were deliberately hinting to me that there was something beyond this world. In response, I started researching this phenomenon and came upon fantastical materials that were purported to be messages from extraterrestrial beings relayed through the mind's and voices of individuals in a trance like condition. A lot of it seemed to be shoddy religious garbage but one set of material stood out called The Law of One It is many years of purported sets of contact with a extraterrestrial intelligence that called itself Ra Intense, effortful dialogues created diligently with purported events so dramatic, yet innocent with great naivety and quirks It's seemingly so honest in its form that I cannot feasibly see this material as completely staged. I've explored the lives of the authors and at the very least, I am convinced that they are convinced that they have actually scribed real transmissions from extraterrestrial life and that they do this out of a love for their work since they gain little income from it. Through the combination of the material and what I have seen, I believe ETs exist. I believe they attempt to reach us but do not impose themselves as to directly change our existence entirely, as implied by the material linked above.

Examples of qbs who stick it out in situations when they could have improved their prospects Chad Pennington, stuck with a godawful Jets team until he was released Aaron Rodgers Eli Manning this year Both quarterbacks contracts were up. Both signed with their original teams. The Jags had 18 million in cap space left over AFTER the free agency period including the blake bortles signing dont tell me they would have signed blake if Aaron showed interest.

I'll lay out both scenarios first to show my thoughts behind this Alcohol related rape A woman goes to a bar, gets way too drunk. She can barely walk, and can't seem to make a proper decision. She's definitely impaired. She was with a guy for most of the night, drinking a lot, and she goes home with the guy. While back at his place, they drink so more, and things start to get heated. The guy implies he wants to have sex, the female agrees. The next day, she wakes up, realizes she slept with this individual, and she realizes not only did she not want to do this, but this was a mistake and forced . She proceeds to contact the police, charges are pressed in court it's stated that the woman could not make a conscious decision as she was impaired. The male is charged with rape, as it's deemed that he took advantage of the female. Drunk driving A woman goes to a bar, gets way too drunk. She can barely walk, and can't seem to make a proper decision. She's definitely impaired. She's with a guy for the night, and he wants to leave. They hop in the car, she's driving. She gets called in by a passerby who reports her erratic driving. She is pulled over, and subsequently ticketed, as well as charges pressed for the woman driving while under the influence. Why do we treat these two situations completely differently? In situation one, the female was too impaired to make a conscious decision. While she may have said yes to sex, she couldn't reliably and consciously make this decision, therefore it does not constitute as her providing consent. However in the second scenario, the female has had the same amount to drink, and if having sex would be too impaired to make a conscious decision. She may have said yes to driving, but she's being held completely accountable for getting behind the wheel. While I don't feel that drunk drivers should be let off the hook, we can't say that they are making a fully conscious decision. On the flip side, I don't feel that people should get off the hook for having sexual intercourse with people while they're intoxicated, but at the same time there is a degree of consent being provided. I feel we should NOT continue treating these matters as separate incidents, as the mechanics arguments for them conflict. We should have a shared punishment for both acts. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

This condition is understandably disturbing in the eyes of society, because doing anything sexual with children is completely unacceptable. By doing so, you are taking advantage of the child, and putting them at risk of serious trauma. Our society often uses the word \u201cchildren\u201d to define young people who still have not developed maturity, or who are not yet considered legal adults e.g. people less than 18, at least in American culture . Now, when you take this definition of \u201cchildren\u201d and insert it into this definition of \u201cpedophile\u201d, the word pedophile becomes \u201csomeone who is attracted to people who are younger than 18\u201d. My view is that this definition of pedophile is wrong. Furthermore, I think that it is not inherently immoral to be sexually attracted to someone just because they are under 18. Sexual attraction is based on sexual maturity, not emotional maturity. During millions of years of evolution, sexually mature girls of any age e.g. even 14 would have been mated with. Even in recent history, in civilized societies, it was common for girls this young to be married. It\u2019s also reasonable to guess that sexually mature boys younger than 18 were attractive to women, but I\u2019m less sure of that. The circumstances of evolution mean that is is completely natural for humans alive today to feel sexual attraction to people younger than 18, because most people reach sexual maturity before 18. Wikipedia says that girls start puberty at 10 11 and end at 15 17, while boys start puberty at 11 12 and end at 16 17. Now, it IS inherently immoral for an older person to have sex with someone younger than 18, because of the possibility of abuse and manipulation and because of the discrepancy in maturity levels. I am NOT suggesting that we change the age of consent. All I am saying is that society is being dishonest when it says that nobody should feel attraction to a pre 18 person. The attraction is healthy and normal, though it must not be acted on. I\u2019ll even claim that the majority of people who don\u2019t feel sexual attraction toward anyone under 18 are actually in denial and unintentionally suppressing their feelings out of fear of judgement from society. I won\u2019t say there\u2019s a specific age that\u2019s a \u201ccut off\u201d between normal people and pedophiles. I think the cut off is sexually mature children vs. children who haven\u2019t reached sexual maturity. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s normal to be attracted to a 8 year old. Based on the Wikipedia ages for puberty, it is likely that you will never run into a child below the age of 15 who has completed puberty, so I used that number in the title. I\u2019ll just end by emphasizing a few obvious things to discourage people who are triggered I DON\u2019T endorse pedophilia, I DON\u2019T endorse sexual contact between adults and people under the age of consent, I DON\u2019T endorse child pornography, and no I\u2019m not Satan. But seeing a 15 year old and thinking \u201cwow, he she is hot\u201d does not mean anything is abnormal about you.

Some examples include cuck, snowflake, manspreading, mansplaining, and SJW. Before I continue, please don't go with the people should be allowed to use whatever language they want argument because of course I'm not telling people what they can or can't say, but I am free to express my reaction and opinion to people using certain fad terms. I am very strongly considered adding virtue signalling to my list of terms concepts labels that I absolutely despise. I'll break down why I am not a fan of this label When I first heard this term, I didn't think much of it. In fact I thought it was a good addition to our vernacular because it got across a very specific kind of idea in 2 words someone who is pretentious, who doesn't really care about an issue, but proclaims their passion for an issue in order to gain acceptance within that group. But then I kept seeing it again and again on reddit, for the past couple of years, almost like it was the new trend or fad to call out someone for virtue signalling. That's part of why I'm not a fan of this term. People acting pretentious and publicly causes they don't believe in has been happening since forever, so why only recently the sudden surge in people being called out for it? It feels like a fad. It almost seems like their concern about virtue signalling isn't even real they just happened to see other people use the term and wanted to join in on the fun. Ironically, while virtue signalling implicitly decries pretentiousness, everytime I saw it used, there was also an air of smugness in the comment. Given how commonly it's done nowadays, from what I see it is as if the act of calling someone out for virtue signalling is a form of virtue intellect signalling. But instead of virtue signalling about a social crises or an epidemic, you're virtue signalling and publicly declaring how you are morally superior because you didn't exploit some public crisis for brownie points like how that guy did, and not only that, but you're also smart enough to call it out. It is used way too frequently even in cases where it doesn't really apply. More and more I see it being used to shut down someone who doesn't provide sufficient proof that they really care about an issue. Or it's used against public figures who decide to use their platform to talk about an issue, or raise funds for a crisis. Unless that person spends the next 3 5 years on that issue, with their hands in the mud on the ground, the idea is that it is acceptable to accuse them of virtue signalling . I find this idea crazy. Everyday we express concern over a topic and then never return to that issue for a while or ever. Remember a few weeks ago how everyone was obsessing over China and censorship, and now people have moved on. Was everyone in those threads virtue signalling? No they were genuinely concerned, but then in an hour they had to go to work, or pick up their kids, or make dinner, and so they logged off reddit, and lived some other part of their life, until they learned about or read about some other social issue. That's the kicker there are other determinants of behavior, and we are bombarded with information constantly. So it's okay to be able to talk about or express concern about a particular issue in the moment, without having passed some purity test of commitment to that topic. All human beings do this. Out of all of the reasons I have laid out, my personal strongest reason for why I don't like this term is within the last paragraph, so if you want to start somewhere, last paragraph would be great.  gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Intentionally removing a part of the game or restricting access to certain weapons, armors, characters, skills, or areas and charging to access those areas is, in my opinion, the definition of selling an incomplete game. However, I think there are plenty of companies that do this right. And by opening up the possibility for DLC Microtransactions, it allows some of these gaming companies to improve the game or further expand the game past its limitations. As a businessman, I understand the restrictions of deadlines, budgets, funding, workload, and creative capability. People work together as a team and every last piece of a game takes a lot of effort and work from the entire team. Game makers often work longer hours think 50 to 80 a week and it's even harder when budget is taken into consideration. By allowing DLC, you allow gamemakers to focus on providing a full experience, and then building upon that full experience. To name some games that did this well Overwatch the only thing that requires extra money are cosmetic appearances. But by using these cosmetic appearances as the only microtransaction, they are actually very successful in the sale. They also keep their content up to date with frequent updates. Horizon Zero Dawn. It seems that they removed a portion of the game the territory that was removed could have been an actual portion of the game , but when they were challenged to deliver on a DLC, they significantly expanded game mechanics. They improved facial expressions, movement, puzzles, design, etc. They added new monster styles and designs that do not impact the story. They added a new weapon type that is stronger, but not necessarily always stronger. And they added challenging new monsters as well. Pokemon with Pokemon Bank . They release the full version of the game, but the DLC version provides full access to all previous Pokemon from previous games you've owned. This is just something extra, and is in no way necessary at all to play the full game. Plus it's cheap. Mario Kart 8 for Wii U. The new Switch version contains the entirety of the game including DLC, but back in the Wii U days, it did not. The game gave full access to all weight classes, speeds, most kart designs, and a full set of racing maps. But the DLC improved upon this and included extra maps more than any previous MK game as well as new characters that did not actually differ mechanically from others. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

And it is not susceptible to political whims or populism mob rule . Equity is completely subjective. It requires a constant changing of government action in order to react to outcomes that are constantly changing as well. It is rooted largely in emotion. It encourages a government that is filled with people who sway with political winds instead of being principled. It creates zero predictability or confidence in an economy and, therefor, hinders economic growth.

I claim this is impossible. My main argument is that Islamic culture is strictly against homosexuality. Muslim majority I looked up Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, UAE, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq countries severely punish homosexual acts to the point of death penalties. Given this, a person who is opposed to homophobia must oppose Islam and Islamic culture, but that is precisely what Islamophobia is Also, a person who opposes Islamophobia must also oppose the hatred towards Muslims when they practice their Islamic culture. However, this will require them to oppose criticism of the homophobic practices. Thus, if someone opposes both islamophobia and homophobia, they must support the criticism of mistreatment of gay people in Islamic culture, and they must oppose the criticism. This is a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible to oppose both islamophobia and homophobia. Response to anticipated counter arguments Turkey has legalized homosexuality and is mostly Muslim Turkey has no state religion. Also, islamophobia does not mean hatred of all Muslims. Otherwise, you would have to accept I'm not islamophobic my best friend is Muslim as a valid defense. Islamophobia does not include criticism of those aspects of Islam Ayaan Hirsi Ali was labeled an anti Muslim extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center for her opposition to the misogynist and homophobic aspects of Islam. Thus, it is considered Islamophobic. Christianity is also homophobic but anti Christian hatred does not extend to criticism of homophobia. This incident did not lead to accusations of being hateful against Christians, so they're not comparable. I'm against homophobia but I don't vandalize mosques Similar to I'm not racist I have lots of black friends , not vandalizing mosques does not make you not islamophobic. You have to be accepting of Muslims and Islamic culture to be not islamophobic, and that directly conflicts with opposing homophboia. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Incels ridicule me for never having a girlfriend and some other people tell me that I need to get experience with having a girlfriend. Growing up, I was frequently told by my parents to focus on my studies and ignore childhood crushes. So that's exactly what I did. Even though in the end, I wasn't a very high achieving student my ATAR was 73, and I had classmates scoring a few ATAR points higher despite not suppressing their crushes , I credit this suppression with helping me learn restraint and Delayed gratification In fact, I worry that if I didn't try so hard to restrain and suppress myself, I might become like Harvey Weinstein in terms of sexual assaults, not movie making . That goes to show what a horrible person I innately am. Also, I am also stalked by an incel who tells me that my life is worthless since I never had a girlfriend but that's not important.

I believe that in order for racism to die off progressively, the 'N' word should not continued to be used, regardless of context. Surprisingly enough, I am an avid fan of rap music. I hear the 'N' word in almost every song that is explicitly labeled. To most rappers today, the 'N' word is a part of their every day vocabulary moreover, its use bears no negativity in their minds unless used by someone who is not African American or black . Even so, there are some famous Mexican rappers who use the 'N' word and most audiences are content with them doing so. In my opinion, regardless of the context behind its employment, using the 'N' word does not only imply to others that its use is acceptable, but doing so acts as a continuation of its existence duh , prolonging its crossover to future generations. To some people, this appears to be unproblematic. So, here is an example from my own life that proves that any use of the 'N' word revives its obsolete, racist meaning. I've lived in San Francisco, California my entire live. Yes, I have visited other places. However, San Francisco has proved to be one of the most diverse cities in the United States. We have whites, Indians, Persians, Asians, African Americans, Argentines, Mexicans, Russians, French people, you name it. I feel truly blessed to have grown up in such a diverse setting. At my old high school, I had black friends in my grade and in other grades. My black friends believed that they had a pass of using the 'N' word, to an extent whereby they gave me the 'N' card for those who are curious, this means I had now possessed the right to use the 'N' word, even though I am not black I still decided to avoid using this word . Henceforth, my black friends and even others freely used the 'N' word amongst themselves because, to them, it seemed contextually acceptable. So, what's the point of all of this? I claim that continuing to use the 'N' word, in any context, prolongs the life of this word this furthers its existence into future generations. And even if the 'N' word is contextually valid for some people to use, the real meaning of this word delineates the atrocious past of colored people mainly African Americans in the United States that still carries over into today. With that, consider this if an 8 year old boy in the year 2051 has this word in his vocabulary, the word's meaning is STILL going to have a racist gravity to it.

For ease of access here are the two final songs Treblemakers Barden Bellas Let us get into proper analysis, starting with the Barden Bellas. Individually Fat Amy was bad, and the main blonde girl was quite poor in my opinion. Really boring voice. The best parts were probably when the redhead sang in the beginning, and when Anna Kendrick sang, although even she wasn't anything spectacular, she just wasn't as bad as everyone else. Group synergy, Song choice, Other Their song was basically a mashup of a bunch of generic pop songs, and they made most of them worse than the original. I admit they had quite good chemistry or synergy, whatever you might call it. Overall I actually felt like there were too many songs mashed in, and I felt that some songs were randomly thrown in without any time. There is a moment where they sing Just The Way You Are by Bruno Mars but only sing 1 or 2 lines from it, and pretty poorly might I add. As for choreography, I have to say they did a good job on this. Pros of performance Good choreography and synergy Anna Kendrick had her moments, redhead had a good start. Cons of performance Poor overly generic song choice also one bad transition Too many songs Poor individual performance would also like to add Overall just underwhelming compared to the songs they chose edit birdy1072 added that they sound much more edited computarized, and their pitch changes. Now we have the Treblemakers. Individually Basically the opposite of the Barden Bellas less people have solo parts but the people that do get them perform excellently. For Jesse, the starting singer, he wildly exceeds expectations and gets the crowd energized while singing in a unique style. Most of this is honestly just my opinion so maybe you can't refute this, but I think he killed it. He has this way of being confident and still very humble. Benji was awesome. The leadup was awesome, his voice was awesome, and the way his confidence built up through his lines was terrific. Following Benji was Donald, and he KILLED it.

Some people know them, some don't, but they aren't as painfully generic as the Barden Bellas. Speaking of generic, they were very original I think throughout the whole song with their use of hitting eachother and making sound. mostly in the first minute or so They interacted with the crowd much better, showed confidence well I felt in some other songs they came off as too cocky but not this one , had great choreography and had unique use of the songs they chose. Pros Fairly unique song choice Soothing confident vocals This feeling of swagger without them seeming like douches Great crowd interaction Great use of everyone in the background's vocals and sounds Cons Not long enough, needs 1 more song Needs a more powerful ending there is an annoying buzz at 48 seconds I think it is quite clear who the real winner is.

So when governments decide which religions will be sanctioned under state law as real religions, while others are not provided the same institutional protection, this represents a violation of the Establishment Clause.

I think it should be amended to permit the infliction of pain as punishment for a crime after conviction. The two most common arguments against using torture are both only relevant to interrogations 1 torture during interrogation leads to false confessions and unreliable information 2 torturing suspected criminals violates due process because they are being punished before their guilt has been proven I agree with both of these arguments and my amendment would still prohibit torture in interrogations. A third objection to torture specifically refers to prisoners of war 3 We can't torture enemy combatants because a it violates international treaties, b it would encourage our enemies to torture American POWs, and c we would lose any moral high ground we might otherwise claim. I also agree with these arguments, and my amendment would not permit torture of POWs. I am proposing allowing states to use punishments such as caning for certain crimes, after guilt has been proven in court. An example of when to use this might be for drunk driving. I often hear stories of people busted for dui for the 2nd, 3rd or even 4th time. Obviously fines, increased insurance rates, and even loss of license doesn't work to deter these drivers. An excruciatingly painful few minutes of caning might have more of an effect. Another example could be for taggers. Singapore is notoriously graffiti free because of their punishments. A third example would be as punishment for people already in prison who commit crimes, attack guards, attack other prisoners, etc. Currently prisons are limited to taking away privileges, solitary confinement, and adding prison time as punishments. Loss of privileges clearly isn't enough to deter prisoners, judging by the high rates of crime in prison. Solitary confinement doesn't work as a deterrent either, and it has long term psychological consequences that I would argue are worse than those that might come from caning. Prisoners serving life sentences don't care if more time is added to their sentence. But all people understand pain and will try to avoid it. I think giving this option to the courts would reduce crime and save taxpayer money. As a bonus, we could also cane the affluenza kid and Martin Shkreli.

These natural rights are fundamental to American society, and the dream and success of our nation has relied on these natural rights. When the government drafts someone for the army, I am arguing that not only is it morally wrong, but these natural rights are destroyed.

This seems to have given rise to situations where bills such as SOPA fail to pass due to public pressure, yet just pop up under another name as soon as the publicity dies down. Eventually, the public gets tired of opposing the same damn thing over and over again and the bill passes not due to merit but because the public has succumbed to issue fatigue. This does not uphold the spirit of the role and duty of government, and should be prevented. I believe that once a bill has outright failed to pass, there should be a mandatory waiting period before it or any sufficiently similar substitute can be reintroduced. This period could possibly be variable, but should be on the order of two to four years. Alternatively, the period could be linked to administration or to the election cycle in order to avoid governments from being directly bound by the bad decisions of their predecessor. In particular, to avoid the possibility of a government purposefully introducing and throwing out bills prior to an election in order to prevent a subsequent administration from passing them. This should be clearly distinct from the usual process of introduction and revision, taking effect only when a bill is outright rejected. The similarity of bills could be assessed with regards to overriding purpose, or individual sections could be looked at separately. Realistically, the objective is to institute some form of double jeopardy, but care has to be taken to avoid being too specific and allowing reintroduction with only cosmetic variations or too general and tabooing an entire issue or area due to one bad bill . One possibility would be applying the waiting period only to the specific portions identified as causing the bill to be rejected, while allowing other portions to be reintroduced. This would prevent otherwise good bills from being put on hold due to a bad and, in some jurisdictions, often outright irrelevant amendment as well as limiting the ability to sneak amendments in by attaching them to essential bills.

If it wasn't a choice, wouldn't there at least be a vocal minority saying it is a choice, but still demanding rights and social accpetance on other grounds? Why would someone choose to be LGBP? People have been killed, beaten, disowned, fired, denied housing, and been oppressed and denied protection in other ways for their sexual orientation.

Here's the video I saw if you've never heard of it. Here's some more info about the project and their goals. And here's my  I don't think this project is necessary people aren't poor because they don't have access to equipment, they're poor because their governments are corrupt, and will take steal equipment like this whenever they want. Right now, we have the bioengineering and construction technology to grow food for billions of people. I don't think people are poor because they lack access to these types of machines, or that it's because these machines are too expensive to buy and maintain. The reason why poverty exists in most parts of the world is due to government corruption, cronyism, and kleptocracy, as exemplified in this video. This type of government malfeasance can even apply to the US, where it's often illegal to grow your own food or set up a roadside stand without spending tons of money on permits and compliance with laws regulations. If there wasn't so much government cronyism, then these farmers in other parts of the world would be able to own property, start and grow a business farm, and be able to provide food to the people who need it. Then, they'd be able to purchase equipment that could help them increase their ROI without having to build it themselves. The idea that a farmer doesn't have enough money to build a tractor at John Deer prices, but does have the money to buy steel and welding equipment to build their own tractor equipment, it also ludicrous to me and almost elitist. Did Marcin Jakubowski ever visit these farms in poor countries to find out what types of goods services they were lacking, or did he just assume it was equipment? I think it was the latter. The OSE project itself has barely been able to stay afloat in the past 11 years and can't even pay for their operations will the sale of goods services. If they can produce a good for 8 times less than the competition, why aren't they selling machines instead? So for now, they still have to rely on user donations. Only one other group tried to build their own machines from these plans for use in agriculture. I couldn't find any updates on this, so please let me know if their are more groups . Don't get me wrong, I think it's great to be able to build your own things and share your ideas with other people. But this idea isn't new, and has been around since people started hacking their Model T's in the 1900s to be used as tractors, bucksaws, threshers, silo blowers, conveyers, balers, church organs, etc. If anything, the OSE should've started production of Model T's, since most people in poor countries don't' even have cars trucks. Those patents must've expired by now, right? Even if a farm in Africa did build all their own equipment using OSE, the government could come and trash it all or steal it anyways. Their videos also use a lot of rhetoric that isn't backed up any evidence, but I'd rather stick to the core idea of the group and why it won't work, rather than delving into all of their gobbledygook .

Listening to his take on abortion changed how I perceived the subject, but by his own reasoning it seems like stopping abortion could never effectively be put into practice. Note This view is NOT about whether or not abortion is immoral, it is about the fact that if Ben's views were turned into policy the results would cancel each other out when put into practice PLEASE TELL ME WHERE MY LOGIC IS FLAWED Here's where things don't add up to me Shapiro says abortion should be stopped because life begins at conception Shapiro believes that healthcare should be viewed as a commodity because removing government sponsorship and mandates would lead to an increase in competition Shapiro believes that abortion is permissible in rare circumstances where the mother's life is in danger, which includes circumstances of emotional distress that would lead to the point of suicide Here's how these points directly cancel each other when put into practice Some people will clearly decide they want to get an abortion They go to a doctor and ask for an abortion The doctor says no because the baby has been conceived and that would be taking a life The patient says the pregnancy is causing emotional distress and feels she would be driven to suicide before she could carry to term whether this is true or not is irrelevant imo because there is no way to prove it aside from making the mother carry to term and seeing if she commits suicide At this point there seem to be only a few ways the scenario could play out according to Ben's logic. The doctor carries out the abortion The doctor refuses to carry out the abortion because they don't believe the mother would commit suicide Since healthcare is now a commodity and there is increased competition, the patient goes to another doctor and states she would commit suicide before she carried to term A doctor believes the patient would commit suicide and carries out the abortion The end result would be that the government adopts a stance against abortion, but nothing actually changes. We know people want abortions for various reasons, and doctors are willing to perform them for various reasons. All a patient would have to do is say they're suicidal, and the doctor would have reasoning to perform the abortion. Doctors that are more willing to perform abortions would get a reputation for doing so and get more business, and patients would simply go to them instead of other doctors that would scrutinize their claim of emotional distress."}, {"conclusion": "Much of evolution consists of changes in gene activation pathways where the concept of information loss is meaningless.", "id": 32898, "argument": "Life-long lactase production the mutation that gives humans the ability to digest milk products is a flaw in the probably originally energy-conserving lactase production shutdown pathway."}, {"conclusion": "Social media is a major contributing factor for mass shootings in the United States.", "id": 47423, "argument": "There is evidence that shows that mass shootings did in fact triple after 2011, suggesting a possible relationship between the spread of mass shooting news on social media platforms and the increase in these crimes."}, {"conclusion": "\"Women-only\" spaces can provide a safe environment for women to discuss issues affecting them directly.", "id": 68161, "argument": "It is important to have such dedicated areas for women to truly feel able to express themselves.

I am highly against weed becoming any more integrated into American culture than it already has been, just as I would be highly against alcohol being integrated into American culture if it wasn't already, due to the dangers of drugs. But I now support legal consumption of drugs that almost everyone enjoys and is already using anyways. Thank you to everyone who helped change my view And thank you to those who commented expressing similar views that I didn't get the chance to read. While many of you may not be satisfied with my slightly changed perspective, I am very satisfied, so I'm turning off notifications for this post. I'm a female college student in the US who has had terrifying experiences while smoking weed. Nine times out of ten, while my friends just got high and happy, I would get stuck in time loops with distorted vision and extreme paranoia and anxiety and I would only smoke a very small amount. I continued to smoke for about a year once a month or so , always thinking the next time would be better, blaming myself for not having the right attitude. But I finally learned my lesson and have quit for good. Weed is not for me. From what I've heard, these are very normal reactions to weed when you get way too high, suggesting that I simply have a low tolerance. I don't judge people who smoke I understand that most people have a great time when they're high. But I know that I'm not the only person to have terrifying marijuana trips. In fact, I'd bet it's actually pretty common. Marijuana can act as a depressant, a stimulant, or a hallucinogen. If marijuana only acted as a depressant, with effects similar to those of alcohol, I wouldn't have as much of a problem with its legalization. But after my personal experience with weed and after hearing my friends' similar stories of getting way too high, I've come to think of smoking weed like dropping low doses of acid, and I can't condone that being legalized. As of now, I don't think it should be decriminalized at all. In fact, I fully support police cracking down on marijuana, though it looks like that is not the direction America is going in. My background with weed is the primary reason I'm against legalizing it, but here are two others Studies have shown that smoking weed causes numerous mental and physical health problems, like decreased memory and attention, lung problems, temporary sterility, and increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Smoking weed is an addicting, unproductive behavior. I'm not saying it's addicting like other drugs I'm saying it's addicting like binge watching TV. I know many people, including my brother and cousins, who can't go a day without smoking weed. Most of these people have told me they think smoking so much is detracting value from their lives, but they are too addicted to quit. And here's an article I found with sources for studies, as well as several other good arguments against legalizing weed I'm subscribed to a lot of subreddits that align very closely with my political views.

I took apart and modified electronics, played with computers, taught myself programming and design at an early age and absolutely loved designing and making things. I jumped out of bed on school days when I had design tech. I still sit around drawing and designing bicycles all the time. It is an obsession. It fills me with joy. My dad failed to make the grades to become a doctor, and this devastated him. He idolised the profession to an extent, and brought me up to believe it was the ultimate profession.

I'm not comfortable with making decisions that can potentially harm someone immediately or years down the line. I have always been one who likes perfection and precision medicine is more about quick decisions under pressure that may be wrong at times, and it stresses me out. My mental and physical health is suffering. I have lived a life of depersonalisation living in a dream like state constantly, with occasional awareness every few months where I realise I'm actually alive like awaking from a slumber where I've been on autopilot for the last two years. I was always so happy, likeable at university. I tinkered with the free time I had.

I bring up the issue and friends get grumpy or suggest I'm a lazy person who doesn't want to work hard. I am drawn towards cogs and gears, the spinning of a lathe, the beautiful precise cuts of a milling machine. The resulting objects of beauty from an experienced craftsman creating incredible mechanical products. I want to do that. I want to spend my days in a studio workshop designing and making custom bicycles, with beautifully crafted components, perfect weld beads and lucious design features like cherry wood ply seat or brass lathe spun head and tail lights. My dad tells me to do it as a hobby, to use my salary to fund this passion in my free time, but I have little free time. I work so hard that I just want to rest, eat and sleep when I get home. I'm in a career where it is almost impossible to have a highly invested side hobby . I don't feel like I'm on the same wavelength as other doctors. I go to the mess and just don't fit in. They're sitting there talking about their dream of having an Aston Martin or BMW, and how you have to get one, or the football score, or medicine. A lot of doctors are quite materialistic. I simply couldn't care less. I sit there trying to join in but my boredom sooner shows through. I've done summer jobs in the bicycle industry, however, and at cycling events I just feel at home.

Did they really need to fix it to give the front runner the first and last words of the debate?

My hope is that if Sanders loses he will run as an independent or a third party candidate. If he doesn't I think I will still vote for a third party candidate and here is why I believe that the main focus we should have as U.S. citizens should be to get corporate money out of politics. To me, this issue is more important than any other issue and Sanders is the only candidate that will do anything about it. If it means the democrats need to lose the next election to open there eyes that we need to stop electing corporate pawns then so be it. It is important to remember that Bill Clinton was the president that signed the bill that repeal Glass Steagall because he was in the pocket of large banks and wall street speculators. It should be mentioned that I also believe that the two party system is really bad for our country in that it de incentivizes progress and promotes the status quo. There is no reason why Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, and Rand Paul should be in the same political party. They don't believe in the same thing. I also feel that people are going to vote for Hillary Clinton for the wrong reasons. I think people will think the economy expanded during the 90s because of Bill Clinton's policies. In reality we were going through a revolution in how business operated. The internet allowed for whole new industries to exist and it had little to do with Clinton or Reagan for that matter. I also think a large amount of women will vote for Hillary because they want to see a woman president. Hillary Clinton tried to encourage this in the first debate which was really gross. Not as gross as her Star Wars reference but gross. The reason I am creating this  is because I realize how much is at stake for this election.

But if they are advocating denial for short term gain or are otherwise not sincere about their beliefs in this regard, then perhaps this will change their mind. There will be discernible sea level rise and global temperature increase by 2100, so it's not like the estates are going to evaporate before we couldn't collect the tax. It's not easy to close an estate esp. stuff like irrevocable trusts etc , and most studies show that it's extremely unlikely that governments will collapse at that point, so again, that tax is collectible. Most rich people at a certain age care very strongly about their legacy and estate.

This is related to the Kardashev Scale which measures civilizations by the energy they have at their disposal. As civilization increases, the energy and tools available to each individual increase including the destructive capabilities of individuals. As we continue on into the future, it seems likely that this trend will continue 3d printers will improve, opening up people to further increased capabilities including 3d gun printing . As we get an improved knowledge of genetics, it may be possible for regular people to be able to have access to genetic laboratories with the capabilities of creating lethal viruses . Even the resources and skills necessary to make nuclear weapons has become more and more common it may become feasible for regular individuals to access this technology at some point. The problem is that more and more people will have the capability of bringing all life on Earth or at least human civilization to an end. This means that it will eventually only take one person who is dissatisfied, who is crazy, or who believes that people are a blight on the planet to end everything. I think that some governments are aware of and concerned for this possibility, which is why people who seem fair and justice minded end up supporting invasive security measures when they reach political office. One way to reduce the risk of an individual ending everything is to heavily control the information available to people controlling the internet , and to heavily control and monitor people's ability to access the resources needed for destructive capabilities. I think that this is an imperfect solution, because it comes at the cost of the well being of most people since we're monitored and can't make full use of the increasing capabilities technology creates , and that it just reduces the number of people with the information required to cause mass destruction government officials, military, etc , so it doesn't eliminate the risk completely. Nevertheless, as technology improves, there is an increasing risk of people trying to end civilization, and draconian laws and restriction of information are one way to help protect against this. The other possibility is the better one, though incredibly difficult we need to live in a world where no person wants it to end, meaning that everyone is satisfied with life and that all mentally unstable people are identified and treated. So in essence, I think that we need restriction of information, heavy monitoring of the internet and limitations of the resources available to people, OR we need to create a world where everybody is satisfied with life, and we effectively treat all mental illness. These are the only two possibilities that I see I think a change in view would come from showing my premises are wrong, or that there are other effective solutions. I would like my view changed because I think that many people will not be convinced it's possible to create a world where everyone is happy and there is no mental illness, and so the only option left will be draconian laws and surveillance, and ultimately the death of the human race."}, {"conclusion": "Birthdays are meaningless.", "id": 114019, "argument": "Birthdays mean nothing to me.

Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the 24 hour period in which we were born when it occurs 365 days later? A year later, the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day, yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning. Sidenote I've gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view.

Oddly enough, trigger warnings have existed off the internet and college campuses for decades. Ever had a TV show tell you Viewer discretion is advised ?

Well, reddit has no legal obligation to give anyone a platform. Also, it doesn't make much sense for them to host racist content. Racism is pretty much universally acknowledged as a bad thing by non racists.

This, of course, is manifested as ignorance of the contributions and impact of peoples of color throughout history and the reduction of these peoples to mere victims in the white man's world, whereas even in periods like Medieval Europe, we see the presence and influence of people of color, the standard brush of history afforded by historians is one of erasure. Dr. Sarah Bonds of the University of Iowa, recently was a guest on Citations Needed and discussed her work on this subject x200B This is not to excuse the arguments of Afro Centrics, like 'Black Hebrew Israelites' who attempt to claim the advancements of every civilization, but to put into scope the audacity of the historical orthodoxy who merely a generation ago still participated in coordinated efforts to deny the accomplishments of any and all African civilizations through the 'Caucasoid Negroid' Hypothesis, a theory that while orthodox not too long ago, receives nowhere near the attention of historiographers as the Black Egyptian Hypothesis. It'd be one thing if historians were above the fray when it comes to racial matters, but we know this has never been the case, as there literally was a well documented movement, particularly during the 19th century in the United States ala Slavery to hide the Blackness of Ancient Egypt. Yes, it is common for African Americans to distrust white scholars on this issue, because historically they haven't exactly been beyond motivated reasoning. What truly is boggling when it comes to this issue is that many historians challenge the notion of race as a concept when presented with visual evidence of Egypt's Blackness in order to avoid the debate altogether. With no other civilization do historians struggle to grasp the reality of race, only in the case of Ancient Egyptians is this defense used. As seen when political pundits can with ease cling to the 'Whiteness and Westerness of historical figures whose existence predated race. Unfortunately, despite the feigned egalitarian efforts of these historians, the lens of race certainly is valid in that race impacts the everyday lives of modern peoples and so too impacts their perception of history. This is an undeniable fact and ignoring this issue is a disservice to our discourse as racists and bigots will co opt these tools no matter how much we pretend they do not exist. x200B So is it Afro Centric to posit the Ancient Egyptians were Black? No more than it is Eurocentric to label the Medieval times as 'White', though this is not a perfect comparison, it shows the hypocrisy of orthodox historians who fail to apply the same considerations and scrutiny to their own suppositions. x200B Let's look at some examples, it is a known established FACT, that a number of Pharaohs were indeed Black, national geographic has done plenty of stories on it. We also know that figures like Cleopatra were Greek of the super incestuous Ptolemaic variety , there no problem assigning race. However, when it comes to other dynasties, Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, Upper Kingdom, historians magically lose their ability to discern the race of certain figures. x200B Queen Tiye x200B She was the wife of Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty x200B Ok tell me this man was not Black. x200B Note that in the Nat Geo documentary I gave you, they are talking about the 25th Dynasty after the Kushite invasion. So this is seven dynasties BEFORE the so called Black Pharoahs of Egypt . x200B x200B Even going back to Menes the Uniter, we see that he has African features, despite the common depiction of Ancient Egyptians having aquiline noses x200B King Tut was remodelled like this His funerary depiction ka is as follows And in life he looked like Michael Jackson x200B This is not to mention Amhose Nefertari, Rameses II, Rameses III, all of which are clearly Black by modern definitions, just look at Ramses III If you're willing to do your research, it's visually clear from the old kingdom 4th dynasty for this example of Menkuare to the New Kingdom Rameses III , there were certainly Black Pharoahs of Egypt. Yes there was the Hykos invasion, yes there was Ptolemaic period, but that's the nuance Ancient Egypt like many other societies was not just 'one peoples' ruling throughout its existence, that must be acknowledged. However from the contemporary writings of Greek historians such as Aristotle, Diodorus, Herodotus, and Strabo all describe the Egyptians as having dark skin, curly hair, and thick lips, often lumping them in with Ethiopians. x200B If anything the Black Egypt Hypothesis should open a deeper discussion on how we define the 'race of a society' and how this concept has been treated historically, rather than the vitriolic rebukes and half handed dismissals we often see on this subject. Was all of Egypt BLACK? Probably not. Was all of Medieval Europe White? Nope. Is it acceptable and expected to depict it as such, and do most educational historic frameworks take this as a given, yes. Why the difference? Why is it so taboo to acknowledge the obviously Black leaders of Egypt, even if it is done without erasing those who were not Black? In other contexts this is orthodox, yet it is not labelled as Eurocentric by historians. But it is. Acknowledging that Egyptians were Black does not necessarily entail the erasure of other peoples, but rather gives important contextual understanding that has otherwise been discarded lost in the name of racism. There is plenty of evidence to suggest this and it should be treated as a viable hypothesis with the caveat that Egypt changed drastically over its many dynasties, rather than some 'Afro Centric' leprosy. x200B Change my mind. x200B x200B Edit For those arguing on genetics, please note the following from Egyptologist F.J Yurco \u201cDNA studies of Nile Valley gene flow. A 1999 DNA study of gene flow among the Nile Valley populations raises even more doubts about the Aryan model's claims of a Mediterranean race sweeping into the north, then branching out to civilize the darker natives further south. The study demonstrates that movement was taking place freely, with more weight of gene flow from the 'darker' South up into the north or Lower Egypt than north south movement. THIS CORROBORATES WITH HISTORICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE PREDOMINANT CULTURAL WEIGHT OF THE 'DARKER' SOUTH LEADING INTO ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST EGYPTIAN DYNASTIES. The DNA data also shows substantial gene flow between Egypt and Nubia, confirming Egyptologist Frank Yurco's observation Yurco 1989 that the Nubians were the closest people ethnically to the Egyptians, and that EGYPTIAN DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND NUBIANS WAS PRIMARILY IN A POLITICAL, NOT RACIAL CONTEXT\u201d. x200B EDIT x200B Couple of notes On the genetic side, please research E1B1B and E1b1a Rameses III for example had E1b1a, which most geneticists interpret to mean he was similar or shared similar traits to what we would call 'Black'. We see evidence of this in the spread of E1B1B the predominate haplogroup of Egyptians, which is almost exclusively African. If the roots of E1B1B are West Eurasian you would expect a higher concentration in West Asia, but you do not. What you might find most unusual about the map below is the fact that the highest concentrations of E1B1B are in the Horn of Africa. x200B Honestly, none of us are geneticists to really debate these findings and an internet forum is not the best place to hash these out. So I understand the lack of understanding. x200B What really is baking my noodle is that almost no one here has bothered to acknowledge that these people look Black. I mean there was one person who posited that they just thought looking Black was cool, which again, is just a joke of a response that can be dismissed without much thought. Curious to see no one acknowledge that the figures I listed looked Black, but rather lean on the idea that we can have Black people who are secretly something else, as if race was anything but phenotypic. Quite daunting to see people who argue that race is arbitrary then turn around to argue for race essentialism in the same heartbeat. I suppose I was hoping for more of an explanation of the rationale of the denial, but all I have concluded is that this denial is essentially ingrained in the institutionally reinforced White supremacist historical worldview of many peoples. x200B Thank you for engaging."}, {"conclusion": "The Taliban is extremely wealthy which can buy them significant power and influence, and therefore popularity, in Afghanistan, a relatively poor country.", "id": 55076, "argument": "Drug trafficking and narcotics are the main financial resources of the Taliban.

The problem is two fold. First, they're a clunky and barely useable solution to the problem of getting streaming online content to your television. All the smart TVs I've used have menu based interfaces primarily driven by the arrow and OK buttons on a sprawling remote control. It's a pain in the ass to do basic things like type in a WiFi password or search for movies without either an actual physical keyboard or a touch driven on screen one. The software is often very unresponsive, taking a moment to update in response to user input. Second, it makes no sense to integrate network connectivity and software into a durable good like a TV. The software is already crap to begin with, and the manufacturer has little incentive to continue maintaining it with performance patches and security fixes after a new model comes out a year or two later. A smart TV lasts far longer than it's profitable to keep and maintain that particular model on the market. Without continuous software support, keeping a smart TV on your network opens you up to emerging Internet threats, assuming the manufacturer didn't already include exploitative software to begin with example 1 example 2 It's far better to keep the display separate from an Internet connected data source. Something like a Chromecast driving a dumb TV is far more preferable because 1. users interact with it through a convenient interface like their phone or tablet and 2. these add on devices receive better software support and are easily replaceable when that support ends.

I'm going at this from a very broad, philosophical perspective. If we define an omnipotent, omniscient deity as a supernatural being with independent goals and intentions, which is completely unlimited by either information or power, then there is no reason why that being would not achieve everything they want, and only what they want. They would not be restricted by conventional causation, so no undesired means would ever be required for any given end. They would be completely in control of the consequences following their endeavor, which would only happen as desired. For example, if such a being wanted to eat an omelette, they wouldn't have to break a few eggs before or do dishes afterward, unless they wanted to. Therefore, it logically follows that if such a being were to create a universe, that universe would be exactly as intended by the creator, and that the values of the being should be the sole components of the universe. In our universe, as far as I'm aware, every conceivable value life, love, pain, chaos, the color blue, paperclips, etc , except for the laws of physics themselves, could be conceivably increased in some way if the laws of physics were to be compromised. To the best of my knowledge, though, these laws are never compromised under any circumstances. Because a limitless being would not be required to use such laws as a means to reach any primary goal, then the laws themselves must have been created and prioritized for their own sake. This leads me to the conclusion that any all powerful being that could have created this universe would have to be single mindedly devoted to the laws of physics, with no other competing values, desires or goals. To me, any being that fits that description would be the laws of physics themselves, rather than anything that fits even the broadest conventional definition of a deity. x200B To address some possible arguments I have heard the argument that an omnipotent being would be completely unknowable, but I disagree. The only situation where such a fundamental being would completely impossible to detect or understand would be for it specifically wanted to hide its intentions. However, I feel like my ability to draw the conclusion that it intends to hide its intentions is sort of self disproving. I have also heard arguments, particularly in the context of the problem of evil, that the deity refuses to interfere despite wanting to end suffering because it values free will. This argument fails for two reasons, for me. First of all, an omnipotent being should certainly have no trouble retaining free will in all people while also eliminating suffering. Secondly, if free will really was the ultimate value of an omnipotent deity, it is easy to see how it could have increased the volume or quality of this freedom, such as by making all planets habitable and accessible to life, or removing unavoidable mental conditions like dementia. I have also heard that, in spite of the deity's power, their actions are restricted by their own codes and laws. While that's logically consistent, I think that such a being would, by definition, not by omnipotent. If I were to see compelling evidence for a miracle that A was demonstrably separate from the standard laws of the universe and B reflected values not contradicted by other parts of creation, then my previous reasoning would fall apart, but I can't even imagine something that could satisfy both of those criteria."}, {"conclusion": "Secular states in Europe do have a connection to Christianity.", "id": 50264, "argument": "The inauguration of some heads of state in Europe requires the Bible or some other reference to God."}, {"conclusion": "Transhumanism might have unforeseen dangers, because it has never been accomplished on a mass scale.", "id": 42214, "argument": "We still have so many unknowns in answering many diseases.

There have been several things I have needed to Google search while proofreading, for example. This may help, but would mostly just look good on my resume. So. Considering those as my options of study, do you think it would actually be worth going to college for one of them?

It typically stems from a glance at a world population graph, seeing the prominent exponential curve, and wondering how we're going to be able to feed, clothe, house, and provide energy such as fuel and electricity to so many people in the coming years. It's all completely overblown. Sure, population has risen exponentially almost since the birth of humanity, but so has technology, particularly food production technology. The more food there is in the world, the more people there will be and modern agriculture was a significant contributor to this. There is a capacity, though. There will come a point where food production cannot sustain such a fertile population, and begin to struggle to sustain our population. Deutsche Bank seems to think this will happen around 8.7 billion people, at which point we will be reduced to 8 billion over the next 50 years. A perfectly sustainable number.

First, some justification. AAA and many other games have been 60 since at least the 90's, and haven't increased in price Adjusting for inflation since. Since 60 has been the golden price for decades, even substandard games can be released at the same price point as actual good games. This is possible because developers are not forced to offer beta tests or demos, and there is no option for perceived initial consumer bias towards more expensive games for increased quality. Since there is no real external metric for determining which games are actually worth 60 or potentially more , an over reliance on game reviewers and first look content creators has developed, naturally leading to such developers and publishers incentivizing positive reviews of their trash games. Besides this rests the various unsavory business practices like cash grabbing the initial hype spike sales then letting the game die, releasing unfinished works only to maybe add more content later, locking content behind paywalls, etc In the age of digital media, there is really no point in every new AAA release being 60. Obviously, game producers are only there to make a profit and their practices will reflect that. It will only take a single courageous developer publisher to release a quality title above the 60 price point to prove that quality should matter. Digital games are NOT like other commodities. It's NOT like a food, where offering a sample has a direct impact on the bottom line as a sunk cost. It is NOT like an article of clothing or a car, where usage immediately reduces the value of that specific unit. Demos protect the consumer, and incentivize product quality over marketing strategy. Until then, developers publishers being allowed to operate from the fog of war is what's killing the quality of games and hampering their progress into the future. There's no point in a developer like EA making Destiny 2 any different than the first Destiny for example, as long as consumers think they should cost the same. It doesn't make sense from a business perspective, and this gates the development of new games to the speed of emerging technology that allows more to be done with the same or similar resources. If developers were forced to release a Demo version of the finish product along with the release, all the power will rest with the individual in determining if the game is worth the price point, and developers would be incentivized to release the most polished, bug free and engaging experience up front, NOT a year later via updates. Not only that, but this would also reduce the burden of game reviewers, taking them off the frontline and removing external or paid bias. Destiny 2 for example, could then be made objectively better than Destiny because it could cost 80 and consumers would understand that it is supposed to be a bigger, better, more improved version of the first title. Every new Call of Duty can also justifiably be so similar because, well, they cost the same so why expect a better experience? And no, this does not cause an inflation of game prices because developers will still want their games to be accessible and affordable, and as technology rises, so will the floor making tomorrow's 60 games better than today's. Basically, if the best of the best games are supposed to cost 60, then its the presence and success of other, low quality games at the same price point that makes it hard for the consumer. Also, because publishers are leveraging the potential returns, it would be possible to offer an amazing, 100 game experience even if not everyone would be able to afford it thats what AAA titles are supposed to be anyway imo.

I think most straight males would have a difficult time not looking at, or not having one or two sexual thoughts if they were in a room full of naked women.

So people fill in the gaps, sometimes that will prove to be incorrect, but if it is more often correct than incorrect it is providing potentially valuable data. Example, if you are walking down a dark alley and some guys are following you, there are a wide variety of valid stereotypes to approximate how much danger you may be in. It is not required for them to be always right to be useful. A guy covered in tattoos may be completely safe, but is he as safe as someone without any? No, of course not. And if you think so, you're simply misinformed or willfully ignorant due to social avoidability bias. If they're a bunch of young black guys, same thing, it's just more socially unacceptable to think such a thing. Are they women laughing together? No reasonable danger.

There is no way to effectively eliminate it without solving why the stereotype is applied. I understand it is demeaning and insulting to be stereotyped, but your feelings don't really change the facts. In the case of covering your body in tattoos, it was actually a choice you made, which removes all moral authority to be offended in the least.

At that point, the baby can\u2019t live on its own, but the mother can, as long as she is no longer pregnant.

However, I speak my mind, and when I see contradiction, I point it out. That being said, enjoy So, in the Abrahamic religions, most notably Islam, women are required to be modest. In particular, Islam makes women wear something called the Hijab. There is much debate about what proper modesty entails in Islam, which is why you see all sorts of variations pop up, like the burka for example which is a full body suit . Most of the time, Muslims have great arguments for why women cover up. Many women will speak out themselves about how empowering it is to cover up. I have even been seeing this picture the one attached to this post floating around facebook lately, also showing support for covering up. And to be honest it just makes me laugh. Here is why Nudity is innately empowering, not clothing. Clothing up, especially because a male religion says so, is not innately empowering. Just think about this In the Abrahamic religions, God made Adam and Eve feel ashamed of their bodies when they broke the rules of Eden. Adam and Eve then covered their private parts with clothing. You see, even in religion, clothing is a symbol of oppression. That being said, there are some women actually many who feel powerful as a result of covering up. How can this be? Well, lets be real, this sense of empowerment has nothing to do with the clothing itself being a source of power. It isnt like a hijab gives women magical powers. No, rather the power felt is directly connected to their relationship with men. Men treat them differently when they are covered up. So in reality, women who cover up are still technically living their lives according to how men treat them. Hijabs are not a source of empowerment, as they, in fact, hide a woman's natural form. The hijab may help divert the male gaze, but a man's sexual appetite is not a womans problem, so why does she need to compensate for his weakness? God having women wear hijab is a punishment to women for a man's problem. Anyone feel like stepping up to the plate in proving me wrong?

So here is my view If you are playing a game honestly, and within the rules a win is a win and how you obtain that win mechanically has no bearing on what kind of player you are. You were playing the game to the fullest capacity and adhering to any notion of using only not cheap moves only inhibits you from performing at the highest level of play.

I also believe botters don't deserve to be punished.", "id": 69868, "argument": "There has been a LOT of talk over the past week or so about botting in Diablo 3. For some context, you can set up a botting program that takes over your mouse and keyboard, and reads the game data. The botting I'm talking about does not inject into the game, and does not do anything a player sitting at the desk could not do. Relevant Diablo posts To see the bot in action Community open letter So here's what my  entails, now that I've hopefully given some details If you are a person who makes a living playing Diablo 3, and or are competitively pushing the top 10 leaderboards like Quin69, Alkaizer, and others , then I understand if you are frustrated by botters, as they can inflate their own stats and make it that much harder for you to make a living. Beyond someone in that position, I don't think botting is a big deal at all. I don't care if leaderboard 468 person is botting. I don't care if people bot and get gear faster than me. I don't care if people bot and gain higher paragon levels than me, and I don't think anyone else should care either. Diablo is a game about personal progression. Most of the people commenting and witch hunting botters are people who can barely beat a level 55 or 60 Grift. To someone like that, why not work hard at beating your own person Grift level, and stop worrying so much about what other people are doing. I also don't believe botters deserve to be banned. To reiterate, I am not talking about people who inject into the game itself. For example, on the PS4 you can join a public game and immediately gain 3000 paragon levels. I don't like hacking the actual game to put yourself ahead, that goes over the line. I believe that, as long as the bot isn't doing anything that you yourself could be doing, then it doesn't matter and you shouldn't be punished for it. My case in point is a friend of mine who loves Diablo. Played the hell out of D2, and D3 when it first came out. Today, he's got a wife, 2 kids, and a full time job. He still loves Diablo, but can only play a few hours a week. If he sees a new, awesome build from a streamer and he wants to try it out, without botting for materials and gear, he'll likely never get to play it. A few weekends ago, he dedicated a Friday night to playing D3 with our group of friends. He wanted to try the new Static Monk. However, he did not have any of the required gear. We spent 4 5 hours playing, and he got 75 of the gear, but not all of it. That was all the Diablo he played for the week, and couldn't even play what he wanted. He then decided to get a bot, so that he could actually play the game and have fun. He has no interest in pushing leaderboards, and no interest in being competitive or beating out other friends. He just wants to see a cool build and try it out. I see no reason to ban this person. So basically, my  is two points Unless you make a living playing Diablo, I don't think it should bother you affect your game that some people bot People who bot should not be punished With the caviat bots that are able to do what a player could do . Effectively replacing the person sitting at the keyboard.

I am writing a paper and would like to know about what view others hold on the same topic. MIT has a compulsory swimming test. The CDC has information on their website that showing how widespread drowning is. From 2005 2014, there were an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings non boating related annually in the United States \u2014 about ten deaths per day.1 An additional 332 people died each year from drowning in boating related incidents. Several college students frequent beaches and other areas with water sports. Knowing how to swim will not only help save their lives, it can reduce the number of deaths due to drowning every year. Children in families where parents don't know how to swim have a much lower chance of learning how to swim as compared to those belonging to families where one or even both parents know how to swim. This may have something to do with those who know how to swim realizing how important it is to swim. Therefore, making sure that college students know how to swim would go a long way to preventing those they know and love from falling prey to drowning. While some may say that it will decrease graduation rates, I believe that everyone should know how to swim. Unlike high schools, most colleges have swimming pools, so access to a pool for the test will not be a major concern for the college. Those who do not want to take the test will be allowed to take an intro to swimming class instead.

However, how does this idea of personal responsibility hold up when an individual is not in total control of their actions? Most people that we see and interact with on a daily basis are fully conscious and alert, but there are also people who can be in an altered state of consciousness. These altered states of consciousness can be caused by a multitude of things the most obvious ones are alcohol, drugs, and injury such as a hit to the head . Some lesser obvious causes can include a tumor in the brain causing personality changes , sleep and sleep disorders such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors , hypnosis, and mental illnesses. In some cases, people who are in an altered state of consciousness can do drastic things. People under the influence of drugs and or alcohol can be aggressive or damage property amongst many other possibilities , some sleepwalkers can be homicidal see the Kenneth Parks case in the right circumstances, a person with a mental illness such as a dissociative disorder could do serious damage to those around him her, and someone with a brain tumor could involuntarily become a mass murderer see the case of Charles Whitman, explained by Rhawn Gabriel Jospeh, Ph.D. . I personally believe that if someone is unable to control their actions because they are in an altered state of consciousness, then they shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for those actions. To be clear, this does not mean that I believe someone who does something wrong under the influence of alcohol or drugs should be free of responsibility because it was under their control to initially get into that altered state of consciousness. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

I know that many people overreact when a new president comes into office, especially when it's someone they don't believe in, but I believe our current president is indeed a threat to the integrity of our democracy. I'll try not to delve too deep into actual policies, since I could go on all day about those. Ignoring the truth Our current president is a vehement climate change denier, proclaims that any media portraying him in a negative light is either despicable or fake news , and trusts sensationalist media like Fox News and Breitbart above his own intelligence committees. The fact that both his fellow congressmen and voters not only allow this sort of attitude, but praise it, indicates that we are entering an era where politics isn't determined by actual facts, but what we feel is correct. Truth is second place compared to our personal prejudices. The defunding of the Department of Education indicates 45 wants to bring this sort of ignorance to the rest of the country as well. Defiance of checks and balances Our government was designed with checks and balances across three separate branches, to ensure that no one person can act like a king. 45 has lived his entire life in a business atmosphere, where the man on top makes all of the rules and nobody can defy him. Conflict is inevitable, and in a sense has already begun. The legislative branch is now a majority of Republicans, who single mindedly agree with any bills or laws 45 proposes, and insist that his actions seem him worthy of the presidency even people like John McCain and smaller senators who show opposition to 45 and his plans still vote by the party line . While the judicial branch is doing some good work, stating the Muslim ban is unconstitutional and hopefully more of 45's other plans, our president continues to insult the so called judges who make the rulings on his Twitter account. Even if he hasn't actually made a move on the courts yet, the fact is that he is sowing a hatred in his voter base of rules and regulations. He is trying to say that his way should be the only way, and anyone who prevents that should not work for him. Potential war? 45 threw out his prior security advisors to replace them with Steve Bannon, a man with a very specific agenda on his hands. Many members of his cabinet are war hawks, and most of 45's budget cuts are going to Defense and Homeland Security. Some reports have also stated that 45 has been lax with security briefings, a situation that mirrors Bush's actions shortly before 9 11. I'm afraid that if another terrorist attack occurs in our country, even if its members are US citizens, 45 will use that as reasoning to attack whatever country he dislikes the most. And as history has shown us, wartime presidents always seem to have second terms. Financial influence Many of 45's cabinet members are millionaires or billionaires. Many laws passed already favor organizations that have done heavy lobbying for the Republican side. There is, of course, the implication that Russia promised 45 a sizable share in an oil company to ensure removal of sanctions. While funding presidential campaigns to further one's own political agenda is nothing new, I fear that corporations and agencies will double down on their lobbying now that you can wear bribery on your sleeve. Normalization of this behavior One of the biggest reasons why I was so anti 45 during the election was the hope that, if he lost by a landslide, we could show Washington that the selfish, malicious, corrupt, and ignorant principles 45 embody would never be tolerated. Instead, he won. People will begin to see that being an asshole to everyone not only makes you successful, but can make you president. Already, I've seen online discussions that, when people begin to show how 45's policies are bad, respond with lol you're just salty because she lost and he won. In the mind of 45's voters, because he won, everything he says is right. In addition, the Republican Party will not learn from their mistakes. After their losses in 2008 and 2012, instead of looking over their policies and considering that maybe they could improve their own party ideology to net more voters, many Repubs just pissed on Obama. This whole attitude of blaming others for America's problems instead of themselves was continued in 2016, and just look what happened. I'm concerned that the shitslinging we saw in the 2016 election will persist, if not become even more volatile, in the 2018 midterms and 2020 election. The 2016 election has shown the stubbornness and an inability to look at your own mistakes will reward you in the end a horrible lesson for our country. There are many other examples I could cite Bannon's interview where he stated his main goal is to basically eradicate the federal government, the legislature sitting on the allegations of 45's relationship with Russia but gladly investigating his made up wiretapping story, and so on, but it's hard enough for me to put my frustration into words as it is. I apologize in advance if any of my arguments are not fully fleshed out, but clearly you have to understand where I'm coming from here. I try to make our country a better place. I've donated to plenty of charities like ACLU and Planned Parenthood and Sierra Club, those who look out for the interests of the common man. I've called my senators and house representatives nearly every week, as futile as it is my Democratic senator needs no persuasion, my Republican senator actively avoids it, and my representative, who does listen and in fact has written back to me, is grossly outnumbered in the House . I try to help others, both outside and inside my job. But I am fucking terrified of the route that our country is headed, not only for myself but for the rest of the country.

Banks are making more money then ever, the people who spent their time protesting most certainly could've done something more constructive. I saw the protestors at Zucotti Park and when they came to Times Sqaure and I actually felt embarrassed for them. The Zucotti Park protestors looked like a large group of gross homeless people and in Times Square they were really just annoying. My family was visiting and wanted to go to Times Square , unfortunately the protest was so obnoxious and in the way of everything that it took away most of the fun of being there as I'm sure it did for thousands of others. Why did they go to Times Square? Most of those people are tourists, I guess I could understand it being done for attention but at that point no one really cared about them anymore anyway. Furthermore what was the deal with people getting so mad at the police and the arrests that were being made? Some of the headlines and coverage made it seem like the protestors were enemies with the police. The police and banks are so far apart, it just split the attention and distracted people from their real cause. There was no reason for the police to be hated on in the manner that they were. There's a reason that banks make so much money, everyone needs a bank at some point in their lives. You can't complain about big banks and then take out student loans to pay for your college education, it's not the banks fault that college costs so much but at least they are providing you with the opportunity to attend. Sooner or later I bet every one of those protestors will walk into a big bank and get a mortgage, open an account, or use some service from the very people that they are against.

This means that although many may claim that attractiveness is subjective, this is far from the truth as there are traits in people that are widely agreed to be more attractive to the majority of people. In women there have been a few traits that have worked to spark the attraction of men, namely big breasts, wide hips, and symmetrical facial features. This can be seen in the physical traits of women that dominate the entertainment industry and 'men's magazines', and also pornography. Those who claim that beauty is completely and absolutely subjective are completely incorrect and choose to ignore this. Due to the attractive traits of Women it can be quite easy to identify which Women are widely agreed to be more attractive. In the case of Men this is far more difficult to ascertain. Although there are certain traits that are seen as attractive muscular bodies, symmetrical facial features, tall stature it is far harder to determine if a Man will be widely agreed to be seen as attractive.

We'd keep electing Ministers and a Prime Minister every 4 years, to exercise the executive power. WHY I believe there are huge lacks of legitimacy in both representative democracy and direct democracy which can be taken care of by delegative democracy. Representative democracy Representative democracy has created in almost every country it is used a very limited choice between people who are likely to become candidates, making it practically useless to vote for other marginal candidates. These candidates often share very similar views, don't respect their promises and as part of the establishment, create an environment where the benefit of the people they represent sometimes comes after ensuring the power remains within the economical, media and political establishment. This, amongst other causes, leads to great dissatisfaction of the people towards the political leaders. Direct democracy I think direct democracy is very similar to liquid democracy except for its one flaw Possibility of huge decline in vote participation. Laws can be very tedious, long, repetitive and complicated. If nbody could delegate their vote to other people then I think we would witness a huge decline in vote participation percentage in comparison to the current parliament vote participation percentage . Low participation of the population delegitimizes the democracy. The current system made a lot of sense in 1867. Each electoral district would elect a member of the Parliament to represent the people of said district. However, in 2016, such small territorial divisions have completely lost their purpose. I cross 6 electoral districts every morning to get to my school where I spend my whole day in a 7th district, only to get back late in the evening and sleep in my district. The time has come to switch from an old political system that served the society of 1867 to a new system that will serve the society of 2016."}, {"conclusion": "I don't think we should celebrate soldiers as heroes when, in reality, they aren't serving the interest of the American public, they serve corporate interest, and they get paid well to do it.", "id": 54433, "argument": "I believe that in the past there were wars worth fighting, such as WW2, and the soldiers who fought in meaningful wars should be celebrated.

They are not fighting for our freedom, they are fighting to take freedom away from others.

I have seen many sources which claim, to a varying degree, that wage inequality based on gender exists in the workplace.

This stems from the fact that the determinants of wage are nigh impossible to account for entirely, and even differences between two genders do not solely in and of themselves prove discrimination. I would like my view changed because every time I have attempted to have a conversation about this issue irl, I have essentially been called sexist, and I would like to see if productive discourse could sway me one way or another. Edit Gotta go folks, I really appreciate the discussion that was had here, a lot of people brought up a lot of very valid points, and made me think about the issue in a different light, while my core stance remains that it is impossible to prove that the wage discrimination of the type I outlined exists, my view was changed slightly in that I can see that it is still a concern to be addressed on a personal level."}, {"conclusion": "For average US citizens, tax returns should be optional or pre-filled, like they do in many European countries.", "id": 135600, "argument": "I feel this is win win for everyone involved.

I think the assurance of a minimum wage is very important to guarantee a minimum standard of life, I think college in the US is crazy expensive, wage inequality is a serious problem, and so on. Over his campaign, many times it seemed like sanders was taking problems, finding a rational solution and taking them to their most reasonable extreme. The economic and practical implications for his policy was many times not considered or ignored. Take for an example He wanted to raise the minimum wage throughout the states. Fair enough, it is a good idea. But he extends it to a point with seemingly no reason by saying the federal minimum wage should be the same in every state, 15 . The cost of living sometimes varies wildly from state to state and town to town, and choosing a single value for the whole country is one of the worst possible implementations of a great idea. Another example is his stance on trade He wants to promote American small businesses, makes sense. But he proposes to reduce the levels of which free trade is implemented internationally with the US, with protectionist policy. Not only does that conservative vision go against his more progressive stance on most issues, it shows a disregard for the economy and people overall. Globalization being fought against by a superpower naught lead to dire consequences. First of all, protectionism usually leads to a in increase in prices, as you can not import as much or as cheaply anymore. This increase will be felt much more by middle to low income households, the ones he's trying to protect. Secondly, although it's usually accepted that a president's duty is to serve his country, it is also important to recognize that he's in a position of great power to influence people's lives from all around the world and should have their well being in mind as well. Protectionist measures can very easily lead do many people in low income countries to lose their jobs, destabilizing their economies and so on. And many of these people don't have any other means of subsistence, their economies are structured based on the cheap labour they provide to richer countries. So essentially, by trying to protect American businesses, you might be inadvertently starving millions of people elsewhere in the world, and that should be a very important concern for anybody who claims to want the best for mankind.

To that end a delta was awarded here to u DHCKris I beg you, please read my fail title as roughly  Irony and hypocracy work great to influence opinions, but IMHO they're red herrings which distract from, and can even be counter to, legitimate and productive between opposing arguments on serious topics. By Arguments I mean the arguments themselves i.e. the 'argument' from design. etc. Onto the actual post TL DR. pointing out irony and hypocrasy often does more to illuminate one's own imperfect knowledge of the world, distracts from real discussion, and doesn't substaintively or coherently contribute to actual arguments regarding the morality, effectiveness, priority, solutions for, etc. about real serious issues in the world. In the sense of irony, i'm using the specific definition wherein an author might say I1 Don't you think it's ironic that Al Gore flew a jet to go to a conference about reducing fossil fuel emmissions? or I2 How could George W Bush claim to be a Christian and still invade Iraq? And while the distinction might be negligible here, I'll clarify on the types of examples of the use of hypocrisy H1 Who is the United States to tell other nations they cannot have nuclear weapons when they are the only country to actually use them in combat? or H2 Let he who has never sinned cast the first stone My view is that, much like how these types of optical 1 illusions 2, make us see things which aren't there even when we are aware of that fact irony and hypocracy are cognitive illusions, in that like how we end up seeing motion or colors the aren't there as in the above illusions, when we encounter irony hypocracy we see importance which isn't there . Now lets take two people making identical claims Mom 1 is arguing that her local school board give money to hire crosswalk guards at all the elementary schools. Mom 2 makes the same argument, but had 20 years prior, in a moment of distraction, accidentally hit and killed a schoolchild at a crosswalk. In the end, when it comes to a public policy decision, all that actually matters is, what does it cost, what are the evidence for expected benefits, and does it violate any laws or rights to implement? What doesn't matter is whether or not the person making the argument happens to either in the past, or currently, acts in a way counter to their own stated opinion. Either the argument works, or it doesn't. An alcoholic might advise someone on the brink of becoming one to drink less. A smoker might tell kids not to smoke. There can be a pro environmental argument in favor of more landfills. Why do they work?, why do they 'hack our priority making' and whatnot? Because to deny the power of the irony is to admit a lack of personal knowledge, and even a threat to our very identity. Hear me out on this If i think that out of necessity we make categories of things in the world and expected behaviors from them. Birds sing, cars roll on wheels, trees grow, and stones rock They are inherently imperfect categories, to some degree hamfisted at some pixellation, but ultimately nonetheless it's important to most human beings, myself included, unconsciously and emotionally that they are true . To admit otherwise is to admit we don't care that what we believe is true . There's an old saying, somethign to the effect of Until we step outside of this, by default people tend to think something aking to 'when I do something to you which hurt you, i was a victim of accident and or circumstance but when you do it to me, you do it deliberately, on purpose, against me.' The us is always just doing their best against this crazy unfair world, but the them does things on purpose, for reasons, as part of a plan. Even the great villains think they're in the right . But when we open our minds and say from I2 above well, maybe GWB thought given limited time, information, and resources going to war on Iraq was the maximally moral this to do in the light of human rights, democracy, and the bible's teachings. admitting that GWB might be, like most of us, a thoughtful and decent person who made a hard choice balancing limited options and information, is to remove the 'otherness', and humanizing a political opponent makes it easier on them so we can't. It' s just easier to 'other' them. So to allow irony to flow through you and tie some opinion making synapses into knots which haven't gone through the proper evidence argument auditing and due dilligence, is to stubbornly stick by a ham fisted category rather than admit you may have formed that category in error or laziness, and thus reveal you aren't a perfect rational being who makes all important choices for fair and logical reasons during moments of complete conscious free will decisioning. And that last bit i think is the most crucial. Irony forces us to go along because to fight against it is admit we don't have the kind of free will our factory refresh brain OS is programmed to think of ourselves as having. Irony holds a gun to the head of your very identity and forces you to go along with it's take. And that's BAD because it leads to entrenchment, lack of open mindedness, and all kinds of media related time wasting cacophony, when all we really want to know is Does the proposition have evidence in support of it, how much does it cost, and does it violate any laws or rights in implementation. Along with a meta analysis or project priority budget triage. But to let Irony become a large part of the serious political discourse among even top academics on topics which actually lead to the life or death or happiness or success of millions is to not treat those topics with the grave seriousness I'd prefer would attend to them. Notes This argument does not speak to trustworthiness of public figures. A source of information by category may over time prove more or less reliable. I don't need more examples to know I don't need to scrutinize something cited by Steven Pinker as much as I do to a top link on r conspiracy. Pinker's earned my trust, r conspiracy hasn't. I'm a huge fan of comedy, drama, etc. Irony in these contexts can be a profound and effective storytelling tool. So i'm not gonna poo poo a great ironic joke, or villain death, im speaking here to discourse on serious issues. let he who has never sinned i'll bet this has done a great deal of good in the world but I'm speaking to a modern, complex world where decisions hinge on all kinds of urgent and counter intuitive factors problems bigger than any single one of us, and having a conversation about the actual facts and effects in reality gets slowed down when the smartest guy in the room thinks up an irony and suddenly he wins, but the project loses. What might change my view? Perhaps I'm missing something and Irony actually has some kind of syllogistic jiu jitsu i haven't thought of that actually plays into real solutions to real problems. Or perhaps you might make a case that the value we get from irony when applied to serious topics is useful moreso than it's in the way. So, bring me back to the normal human fold, make me love irony in politics again, Change my view edit added TL DR at top."}, {"conclusion": "Instead of collaborating and learning, the aggression could lead to conflicts instead.", "id": 103751, "argument": "If a teacher approaches students that are more aggressive, they would be less open to teaching them."}, {"conclusion": "There is no such thing as an unexpected/unwanted pregnancy", "id": 67419, "argument": "Edit Let me rephrase, there is no such thing as an unexpected pregnancy when using forms of birth control inappropriately or none at all. Nothing is perfect and will always have a failure rate, if you choose to use any from of birth control.

What I'm referring to are individuals who do not use birth control or use it inconsistently, and then are unexpectedly pregnant. I believe there is nothing unexpected about a pregnancy when limited to zero birth control was used. There are multiple forms of birth control available to both men and women.

And yes, while no form of birth control is 100 effective That's is why there are multiple forms of birth control that you can use condom and birth control pills, for example . In that same vein, that 1 5 likelihood of failure partially exists because of misuse or poor practices. For example, a recent study found that 20 of men often purchase or use incorrect size condom. If you happen to be in that small percentage of failure rate, where it was purely failure on the product's behalf Then I concede and that truly was unexpected. But that often tends to not seem to be the case. The term unexpected pregnancy is often used in the context of being financially unprepared but there is nothing unexpected behind not using birth control appropriately or at all and then getting pregnant. For the sake of argument, this obviously does not include victims of rape nor does this include abortion as a form of birth control because I am aware that it is a difficult subject and not readily available everywhere."}, {"conclusion": "\"Self-segregation\" on college campuses isn't a \"problem\" that we should bother solving.", "id": 58807, "argument": "Student self segregation on most American college campuses is still overwhelmingly common, despite all of the various sociological treatises condemning the practice. Personally, I do not believe that anyone has an obligation to diversify their peer group if they don't wish to do so, and I've also observed all of the following things from my research about this phenomenon Whites overwhelmingly blame minorities for engaging in self segregation. I find it odd that a large percentage of whites object to the very existence of minority student organizations, interest groups, and clubs on college campuses after all, white students are never blamed for self segregating when they join frats sororities that are 98 white. In my experience, white students who complain extensively about minority self segregation have often made no personal efforts whatsoever to reach out to minorities. If white students were really concerned about solving this whole matter, then they could simply choose to sit beside the black kids in the cafeteria or join minority interest groups. By and large, however, they choose to shun these opportunities and place all of the onus for reaching across the racial divide on people of color. Minority students often self segregate due to perceived white hostility. I've not met too many fellow black students who hate or even strongly dislike white people or white culture however, I have heard many blacks express very real concerns about how they are traditionally viewed by the racial majority. If you believe that whites are on average more likely to treat you poorly, then it makes sense that you'd be reticent toward the prospect of interacting with whites. Even those who claim to be free of prejudice likely have some level of in group preference. In group preference is heavily tied to the fear of outsiders that evolution encoded deep into the human psyche, and this preference is easily observed in how race functions in modern day society. For example, according to a recent poll conducted by Reuters, 40 of whites and 25 of minorities say that they have no close friends of other races, and the vast majority of people are exclusively attracted to those who are of their own race.

It\u2019s neither necessary, possible, nor desirable to erase all gender norms, since they are willingly followed by most.

It\u2019s thus reasonable to expect the individual to request certain pronouns if it\u2019s important to them.

People care about them only because they don't want a massive war in the middle east, and even if that region went straight to hell, it would basically be a bunch of small, irrelevant nations killing each other. Asia has China and Russia, a bunch of tiny countries that are not important, and Japan and South Korea. South Korea is a lot like Israel, impressive for it's weight class, but still basically exists with the permission of China. Japan has been slowing down in recent years, and will only continue to do so, what with their dysfunctional culture. I will admit though, they are borderline contenders. North America has, of course, the USA, Mexico, which obviously has too little power to do anything, and Canada, which is just not in the same tier as the others, and doesn't have a big sphere of influence. They mostly stay up north and quietly do their own thing. Australia is like Canada. I wouldn't want to invade there, but it's not like they're going to be invading anyone else. New Zealand is a total afterthought, that of course, only exists at Australia's convenience. Europe is mostly the domain of people that were major players 300 hundred years ago, but have mostly faded away. Germany and England are still wealthy and powerful, but Spain, France, Italy, and Greece are just shadows of their former greatness. There's a bunch of small countries that don't matter Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg , and everything east of Germany belongs to Russia, they just haven't gotten around to taking all of it yet. The thing is, I'm not trying to bash any of these countries I've got nothing against Guatemala, or Egypt I'm sure the Philippines and Denmark are great places to live, full of nice people and an interesting culture. The Israeli's and Poles are fierce warriors that everyone should respect. I am not saying that a country has to be top dog to have any value. But I do think none of those countries can really hold a candle to Germany or Britain. When people go on about how America sucks and has terrible education and a ridiculous prison system and that Finland is superior in every way, I have to roll my eyes. I mean, sure, Finland has great schools and a super low crime rate, but that's only until Russia steps on them, you know? I would never want to move to a country that lives in the shadow of a giant, and I think it's kind of arrogant for any of these countries to hold themselves above, say, the United States, when a lot of them exist only because we protect them. Kind of like a 17 year old kid deluding himself into thinking he's smarter than everyone else, when really he's so out of his depth it's almost comical. I know this  is kind of all over the place, so to Change My View, please show me evidence that I am unfairly judging a lot of important countries, or that my knowledge of world politics is skewed. I don't think it's enough to find one country that is in the same league, because then my view switches from Only 4 5 Countries Matter to Only 5 6 Countries Matter . No substantial difference. EDIT Hey all, thanks for taking the time to come in here and hash it out with me. Most of you brought up some good points and helped convince me to Change My View, but I want to give a specific shout out to fuchsiamatter, who helped me realize that everyone can make a difference no matter how insignificant they may seem, and to Mongoosen42, who convinced me that I shouldn't hold my own preferences above everyone else's.

There is an argument that it constitutes an instance of homicide. Very internally conflicted about this, fully expect to see a good counter argument, and indeed would welcome it.", "id": 48246, "argument": "Using a throwaway as this is a sensitive issue and, perhaps, a controversial opinion. I have every intention of following up on this post and replies made to it . At the outset I would like to say the following The religious arguments against abortion hold no weight for me whatsoever. I have as little time for them as I have for religious arguments against homosexuality, for example. The view I state in the title is one that I am far from secure in and I expect that there will be a good counter argument out there, and I would like to hear it. I arrived at this view, independent of anyone else, as a result of following what I believe to be the logical consequences of principles that I apply in other areas. These principles are humanist, and in other areas lead logically to conclusions such as 'You have no right to tell others what sex they may or may not have, and with whom they may or may not have it, with the sole exception that this sex be conducted healthily between consenting adults'. Such a conclusion as the one above is a principle that I am eminently comfortable with. It troubles me therefore that the same basic tenets can lead me to a view that is so contrary to normal secular humanist thinking, and contrary also to my instinctive moral reaction, on abortion. Presently, however, I can't escape the logic of it. I expect there may be a flaw in my reasoning somewhere but I've not found it myself. I struggle to get views across in prose without waffling, so I've bullet pointed the steps my thinking takes to arrive at this point You have the right to do whatever you wish as long as you do not harm anyone else. This logically follows from the concept of personal agency. You have agency over your own body. This is true for every person human in the world. There exists no clear biological or philosophical \u2018dividing line' after which an embryo \u2018becomes human\u2019 during the course of pregnancy. Therefore the only possible non arbitrary \u2018line\u2019 that can be drawn between \u2018human' and 'not human', is the point of fertilisation. Therefore a pregnant woman is for the entirety of her pregnancy carrying a separate entity that is a human being at every stage of the process. Therefore an abortion violates the right of the embryo to basic personal integrity and agency the mother is \u2018harming another\u2019 The question of abortion does not therefore resemble the question of, for example, consenting sex between adults in terms of personal agency. Crucial in this is the question of at what point the embryo becomes a human being. Philosophically, one cannot be arbitrary about this, otherwise it is possible for an embryo at for instance 24 weeks to be considered 'human' and an embryo at 23 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours to not be considered 'human' a clear absurdity. In my contention the only clear line, as I have said, that is not hugely arbitrary is the point of conception the point of the completion of the genetic constitution of a human cell. The standard 'pro choice' argument is that 'a woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body' and that is absolutely correct, and it would be anathema to me to ever argue anything else. However, does a woman have the right to choose what she does with someone else's body? Logically, that is what I believe the embryo must be considered as. The argument I set out above does also possibly allow for exceptions In the case that the embryo is demonstrably not viable i.e. philosophically already dead In the case that the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother producing a moral conflict between the agency and integrity of the mother and that of the child In the case that a pregnancy results from rape as this means the pregnancy itself is a violation of the mother's own personal agency However, it does not provide for an exception where the mother's quality of life or her physical or psychological health would be damaged by carrying the pregnancy through to birth. Nor does it provide for an exception in cases where the child would be born with severely reduced quality of life, such as with severe genetic disorders. Instinctively, I find this difficult to wrap my head around, ethically. This sort of thing is part of why I struggle so much to reconcile my thoughts to themselves on this particular issue and thus, why I've posted this here."}, {"conclusion": "Sex Work is a victimless crime.", "id": 60176, "argument": "I've been folloiwng the debates around sex work for a while now, and they all seem to come down to one fundamental impasse Are people who sell sex victims prostituted women , or simply people doing a job that deserves labour protection sex workers . I've thought about this, and I think that it is very difficult to imagine any situation in which a sex work can be called inherently violent or harmful. My argument revolves around four hypothetical sex workers, ranging from somebody who freely chooses and genuinely enjoys sex work, to somebody who is violently coerced. I believe that none of these people are victims of sex work per se . The first hypothetical is a woman who has marketable skills in other areas, and could easily get a job that isn't sex work, but chooses not to because she genuinely enjoys sex work, and is happier there than she would be in any other job she can think of. She is not coerced in any way. The only way you might make an argument that a person like this is a victim is if you say that her fundamental concept of happiness has been shaped by male oppression, or something like that. To that I say Who cares? If freeing somebody from supposed oppression will make them less happy, then maybe you shouldn't bother. Furthermore, this person will suffer as a result of any legal interventions to rescue any of the other hypothetical cases considered below. The second woman is in sex work out of her free choice. Like the first, she could get another job if she wanted. But she doesn't really enjoy it. She might tell herself she does, but whether she knows it or not, she would probably be happier in another job. So, yes, sex work makes her less happy. But how is that different from any other job? There are plenty of people who have gotten themselves entrenched in jobs that make them miserable, whether they work at a desk or on a construction site or whatever. Yet we don't try and use the law to rescue these people from their own choices. So why the double standard for sex work? The third woman is trapped by economic circumstances. She is a sex worker because she needs the money to survive, and has no access to any form of alternative employment. Sex work makes her miserable, and she wishes she could get out. But even in this case, she has made a free choice. She is doing sex work because however unpleasant it is, it is still preferable to the alternative. It is, of course, to the shame of all of us that we allow a situation like this to occur in our society. But this woman is being victimized by her economic realities, rather than by the sex work itself. Sex work, in fact, is making her sitaution marginally better, at least in her estimation. The solution here is not to yank away the rope she has grabbed in desperation, it is to try and put some firm ground under her feet so she doesn't need the rope. So this case should be tackled by addressing fundamental economic inequalities, possibly by introducing a guaranteed minimum income or something like that. The fourth woman is a victim of violent coercion. Maybe she has been trafficked maybe she is under the control of a pimp but either way, she does sex work because there will be violent retalitation if she does not. There is no doubt in this case that she is a victim, and that we should try to help her in some way. But even without laws against sex work, what is happening to her is already illegal . Assault, battery, threats, abduction, and other forms of violent coercion are already more than enough to put a pimp in jail, and get her into a women's shelter. Furthermore, sex work is not the only kind of work that people are violently coerced into. Slavery still exists in the present day, including in developed countries, and is used in a wide variety of industries. But we don't address in the thai fishing industry by going after the fish we do so by going after the slavers. So once again there is a double standard here. We should enforce against violence, not against sex work. I realize that the four cases I've come up with are a bit of an oversimplification, and real life sex workers probably blur the lines between these categories. But I think this demonstrates that sex work can be thought of as a job like any other, and when people are coerced into it, we should see them as victims of coercion, not of sex work."}, {"conclusion": "Joseph Smith took Samuel T.

I think people often over complicate this debate. People talk about the rights of the baby vs the right of the mother, what happens after the birth, what if she\u2019s raped, what if it\u2019s incest, what if she can\u2019t afford the child, etc. My argument is that it is much simpler if an issue than this. Either it\u2019s a human life, or it\u2019s not, and nothing else matters. This is the only thing we should be debating, and while this particular issue is very important and necessary to discuss, it\u2019s just not as complex an issue as it\u2019s made out to be. The reason I say that whether or not the unborn fetus is a human life or not is the only thing that matters is the following. Under the premise that it is not a life, you can do what ever you want with it. It\u2019s like a kidney, or a spleen, or an appendix, and no one else can tell you what to do with it. On the other hand, under the premise that the fetus is a human life, then you cannot morally kill it, under any circumstances. You just can\u2019t. There is no situation in which any of one person\u2019s rights supersedes another innocent human being\u2019s right to live.

I\u2019d just like to post my thoughts on this up here so as to avoid repeating the same answer. I believe there is a distinction between compelling someone to sacrifice their body to attempt to save a life, and compelling someone not to actively terminate another\u2019s life. The first is not okay, the second is. Also, under the premise that the fetus is a human life, it has the right to bodily autonomy too, which is certainly violated by crushing ya skull, sucking out its brains, cutting off its limbs, and pulling them out one by one. Edit 4 It has occurred to me through all these discussions about bodily autonomy vs the right to life that there is another part to the issue beyond just whether it\u2019s a life or not, and that is whether the right to life trumps the right to bodily autonomy. While I still believe that life is more important, that fact that this is also a debate that needs to be had contradicts my original position. I don\u2019t think that I can award a collective delta, so this is my way of doing that Final edit Okay, this has been fun.

If you need any of mine, just comment, or send me a message. Contention 1 Free Tuition Increases Attendance to Community College According to the Gates Foundation, 52 percent of those who dropped out of college did so because the cost of tuition was too high and or unaffordable. This is proof that if tuition was not a factor for students attending community college, many would have completed their education at the establishments. We will prove throughout the rest of the round that education and its increase provides a net benefit to society. In a study performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research it is found that a 1,000 drop in public tuition increases the college attendance rates of high school graduates by 4 percent. This means that once the guarantee of free community college education is implemented, enrollment will increase by approximately 13 percent, considering that the average cost to attend a community college is 3,260. This also means that any benefits currently present in the status quo due to community colleges will be amplified when tuition is made free. Contention 2 Taxpayer Investments in Community College Pay Off In order for tuition to be waived for community colleges, it is obvious that the government will have to invest a certain amount of money. According to an analysis by the Economic Modeling Specialists International in association with the American Association of Community Colleges, taxpayers in the U.S. paid 44.9 billion to support community college operation during 2012. The present value of the added tax revenue stemming from the students' higher lifetime incomes and the increased output of businesses amounts to 285.7 billion in benefits to taxpayers. Savings to the public sector add another 19.2 billion in benefits due to a reduced demand for government funded social services in the U.S. This amounts to a 680 percent return to taxpayers. In other words, for every dollar of taxpayer investment into community colleges, the taxpayer receives 6.80, or a 5.80 net benefit. This proves that any taxpayer investments into community colleges, will, in the long run, greatly benefit each individual taxpayer. Contention 3 Jobs Require Postsecondary Education According to an analysis performed by the National Commission on Community Colleges, half of the new jobs created in the next decade will require some form of postsecondary education. Community Colleges are the bridge to this postsecondary education. Those who would attend community college if tuition was free, as shown in Contention 1, will now be able to obtain a degree and contribute to society with their employment. Of course, most individuals in the job market also want to have an adequate amount of pay. Community colleges also alleviate this issue. Also according to the Economic Modeling analysis, students who achieve an associate\u2019s degree can expect 41,900 in income per year, approximately 10,700 more than someone with a high school diploma. In addition, an associate degree permits the community college graduate to almost double the average annual earnings of high school dropouts 37,990 compared to 19,915 . Associate\u2019s degrees are therefore very beneficial to individuals, and provide a distinct advantage over solely a a high school education or only part of it. Contention 4 Total Economic Impact to Society Abolishing tuition for community college will result in many positive economic impacts to society. Society as a whole in the U.S. will receive a present value of 1.1 trillion in added income over the course of 2012\u2019s community college students\u2019 working careers, according to the Economic Modeling Analysis. Also, the total effect of America\u2019s community colleges on the U.S. economy in 2012 was 809 billion, approximately equal to 5.4 of the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. This is immense, because when community college tuition is made free, these impacts will expand. The amount of added income over students\u2019 working careers in subsequent years will increase as the amount of students attending community colleges increase. In addition, the United States Economy will experience fantastic growth to its GDP when the amount of people with degrees increases and this will be a direct result of making community college tuition free. Also note that for every dollar that taxpayers spent on America\u2019s community colleges in 2012, society as a whole will receive a cumulative value of 25.90 in benefits. This means that even though taxpayers themselves receive a net benefit individually by investing in community colleges, taxpayer investments also lend to a net benefit to society as a whole. Contention 5 Social Benefits Sub Topic A Reduced Crime Levels According to the Economic Modeling Analysis, crime savings due to an increase in people with a community college sum up to 8.3 billion, including savings associated with a reduced number of crime victims, and reduced expenditures for police and law enforcement, courts and administration of justice, and corrective services. In addition, it is found that that those with less than a high school education have over a 2 percent incarceration rate, high school graduates have over 1 percent incarceration rate, but those with even a little college education have close to half a percent incarceration rate, and those with an associate\u2019s degree have a next to 0 percent incarceration rate. This is concrete evidence that A An increase in the amount of people with a community college education yields economic savings and B The incarceration rate of people decreases as their level of education increases, especially after receiving some form of college education. Sub Topic B Reduced Unemployment Rates Also according to the Economic Modeling Analysis, those with less than a high school diploma face an unemployment rate of over 12 percent. Those with a high school diploma face an unemployment rate of over 8 percent. Those with some college face just under an 8 percent unemployment rate. Those with an associate\u2019s degree face only a 6 percent unemployment rate. In conclusion, those who have attended community college and received a degree are more likely to receive a job, thus impacting society with a lower unemployment rate, and benefiting the individuals at the same time."}, {"conclusion": "If there are more weapons on colleges the likelihood of gun related accidents increases.", "id": 33844, "argument": "Students who have anger issues and get into fights can use weapons in those situations."}, {"conclusion": "Iraqi civil roots are strong enough to avoid civil war if US leaves", "id": 102241, "argument": "There is a strong tradition of civil society, civic institutions, and literacy in Iraq.

In addition to that, my lack of trust between men has come from a personal sexual assault from a former best friend whom I knew for a year. He was my first kiss ever and was someone I really trusted only to have been violated and scarred psychologically I reported the incident . If the saying rings true that all men are animals , then why aren't they locked up? It makes me feel that men only use women for sex and hide their true intentions. Third, the misogyny and hypocritical instances that comes from the men my family makes me feel that a relationship with a man will make me feel unhealthy and worthless. For instance, a recent family member of mine commented on my weight grandpa when we were eating at a restaurant when ironically, ALL of the food places he tried to treat my entire family at were buffet style foods and not to mention he eats a lot and is fat. Another instance is when my family members decided to blame my aunt entirely for the divorce of my uncle and why he decided to commit an affair for 8 years and they treat my uncle like he's ok even when he got his mistress from another country pregnant and has an unwanted son. Lastly, the misogyny that I hear from my male colleagues in my field and group of people I meet I'm in student government so I meet a variety of groups is so apparent. Like they try to say a woman who is assaulted like me is asking for it despite the fact that I was wearing jeans and I wasn't drunk. In addition, there comments talk about how women are, too mentally weak for the field I'm in. So all in all, my viewpoint is that there is no point in having any romantic relationships including hook ups I don't participate in them but in that category with a man because he will eventually divorce or leave me due to weight problems and some potential misogyny he may be hiding. The pain over the pleasure is too great. In addition to that, as someone with not good looks and is trying to lose weight, I would feel skeptical because most men who would display interest in me might be for my body. Final note, I feel discouraged from trusting men because a lot of the refutes I got always mentions, not all men , which makes me feel like they are deflecting my intentions, which may not be true but I feel misunderstood. Change my view, I'm open to it and willing to listen. Edit so far, I still stand by my statement by 75 albeit now I got a better perspective thanks to all the generous contributors.Yes, I can't generalize that all men are there to get me. Which leads to my next point, if men with biological urges are to breed out as much as possible to ensure the longevity of his genes,what is the incentive for me to be with a man if he's already got other options? Edit 2 wiling to change my mind still.Ringing in at 60 based on some responses. Some may call me sexist. On the contrary, where are the institutional benefits for women again?? Besides divorce allegations, which really, is time consuming and actually left my female family member more worse off than before without a house? The justice system withheld me the innocent proven guilty, which may be beneficial for some but not for others? The benefits of relationship do include stability or comfort. Now the question is why would I want a relationship? If not all relationships are permanent, what would be the point of a monogamous one besides marriage benefits with taxes or companionship if you get bored. Edit 3 I said I was losing weight and AM making no man responsible for my happiness and I also reported my rape.

Its so short sighted and is as if the whole of society has just accepted the rat race created by the Federal reserve's mandate to create inflation and just seem to want additional check points along the way with cheese so they can keep running the maze. It would make more sense to me to just stop inflation so the poor or everyone for that matter stop getting taxed which is what inflation is every time the Fed prints a dollar. I know many people will say that deflation is bad because if prices come down then people won't spend while waiting for a better deal and we will just get stuck in a downward spiral of jobs getting lost while everyone waits to spend their money. I never understood that argument either because with all products from TV's to refrigerators to cars and even homes people buy them as soon as they can afford it because they want it now. TV's come down in price every year doesn't stop people from buying one every couple of years to get the best tech that's on the market. Despite decent used cars being available people still buy new ones. there really is no logical basis for any prolonged collapse spiral due to people waiting for a better price on everything. That's just not how it works The only real problem we have now is that rat maze that has been built over the last 100 or so years due to constant inflation of the money supply is that if we were to correct to the problem and shut down the maze the result would be temporary catastrophic as the deflation or lack of cheese that would occur that would bring us back to some sense of normalcy would be pretty painful.

In the 1970s and 1980s you had two door sedans as a common thing by 1986, outside of premium marques like BMW and semi premium brands like Buick, the only two door sedan available was the Opel Ascona Chevrolet Monza in Brazil and Latin America . In 1981, Ford had deleted the Cortina two door sedan from its line up apart from selling a 1600 L two door for motability customers and the trend had all but disappeared.

Subaru are a brand whose niche is offering all wheel drive on all models without offering off roader like vehicles they have quasi crossover hatchbacks and sedans with AWD the XV, Outback stationwagon and Forester stationwagon . The Legacy is a decent sedan, but even that probably isn't selling as well as crossovers.

Although an entertaining idea, and it makes for good shows, it's blatantly unrealistic. For one, zombies are often slow, relatively mindless, and have no other 'weapons' besides their hands and mouths. Scratching and biting . Todays militaries are well equipped with machine guns, bombs, planes, tanks, etc, and are very well trained. They are used to fighting people who fight back with guns of their own, and going against zombies would be a relative piece of cake. Also, because of zombies lack of intelligence, and lack of resources, you could go many places a zombie can't get to. For example, you could hunker down on top of a tall building, and shoot them from up top. You could get many soldiers onto aircraft carriers, and other boats. You can safely fly around in a helicopter, and planes, while easily taking out the zombies. I feel that in a case of a zombie apocalypse, they are no match for the strength, intelligence, and resources of the militaries around the world. In fact, the US government and CDC even have a plan already in place in case of a zombie apocalypse Edit It seems I should have defined the zombies and what they are like. For one, I am talking about the stereotypical spread of zombies, where it is basically a virus that is spread through biting, scratching, etc. Also, as far as the zombies capability, lets just say they are capable of sprinting like in World War Z. I don't see why zombies wouldn't be able to sprint, unless of course of an injury. Another problem I have run in to is the debate about if body shots could kill them or if they could carry on. This can be open for debate, as I'm no master of anatomy, but realistically, I don't see how they could carry on without some of their major organs. If you assume that shooting the heads of zombies kills them because it kills the brain, that means that brain is working. For the brain to work, it needs blood to carry oxygen to it. Which means the zombie needs its heart to pump that blood through the body. This also brings up the idea that zombies could bleed to death. And then there are other organs of course and arguments for the need of them, like the stomach and intestines to digest the food they eat, to provide the energy for them to move around and sprint and chase their prey. So unless someone can provide an argument that they wouldn't need these other vital organs, we're going to assume shots to the body can kill them, and not only head shots. If I need to define anything else about them, let me know. For general purposes though, these are your average, stereotypical mindless walking and running when it sees prey zombies. Also, a argument I've seen a lot is that the military would need supplies coming in like food, ammunition, electricity, oil, water, etc. Essential things. I have faith that the military would know this and work to secure places that produce these things to keep it going. Fun fact, the government and CDC actually do have a plan in place in case of a zombie apocalypse.

While in Beijing, on September 5, 1995, First Lady Hillary Clinton, stated \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d Since then, Hillary Clinton has been fighting to make the lives of women and men equal. Aside from women\u2019s rights she has helped attain healthcare for millions of children, continues to stand up for LGBT rights around the world, and previously ensured 911 victims and response members that they would receive the healthcare and resources they needed to recover. These are few among many of the accomplishments Hillary Clinton has to her name. Her website, HillaryforAmerica lists more and her goals and concrete plans for the future. Due to her experience and evidence of work completed in the political realm, there is no doubt in my mind that Hillary is the most qualified candidate for the presidency of the United States. However, men and women, as with all candidates, continue to deny the truths about the good she has done and disqualify her due to her personal life and \u201cBenghazi background.\u201d Does it matter for our future if Hillary Clinton really has a bout of pneumonia right now? Does it matter for our future if her husband had a previous affair? The truth is, what matters is often what is ignored. Hillary is ready for stand up for the middle class, she is ready to reform healthcare, she is ready to demand paid maternity leave, she is ready to raise the minimum wage, and she is ready to make college affordable. She is determined to let go of the past and focus on the future she is not afraid to make the largest investments needed for America. It is also my belief that children need to be raised in a world that does not allow only men to set demands with a demeanor that women simply do not have. They need to be raised in a world where sexual and racial inequality does not exist, where all human beings are treated with respect, and a country that continues to be strengthened by the bonds of all ethnicities and cultures. I believe seeing a woman in office will help the youth understand that no dream is too far out of sight. Hillary Clinton previously held the title of Secretary of State, Senator, and First Lady, and has been an advocate for women's rights for many years. This is why I believe she is a qualified woman running for the office of presidency and why I believe that other women should vote for her. I believe she will be able to eliminate the inequalities and double standards surrounding women because of her experience. However, candidates sometimes do not do what they promise and this is why I am open to learning about why you may believe that she is not that best choice."}, {"conclusion": "Gay people should be allowed to marry at any church, and no wedding company can deny them business on their sexual orientation.", "id": 51404, "argument": "Marriage is a state institution, not a religious one.

Rather than giving busy work for the consumer, why not mandate the food packaging be in recyclable or biodegradable material, which isn't an impossibility, Taiwan in the last 30 years went from being buried in garbage to transitioning to a drastically low municipal solid waste being produced per capita. Taiwan did this not by imposing consumer level bans, but products having as little of disposal packaging as possible and the residents have become expectant to have only recyclable packaging since fees for garbage removal is nearly exorbitant compared to free recycling services with multiple collections every week day to haul away recyclables. The consumers are both choosing to purchase less disposable packaging and the businesses are less likely to use disposable packaging. The bans on plastic straws and shopping bags shifts responsibility from the companies that produce the bulk of the disposable garbage onto the consumer who is just reacting to what's being made available. This also communicates to the public how environmental degradation is a non issie akin to demanding everyone to send out thoughts and prayers and only thoughts and prayers to tragedies rather than changes to public policy or effective assistance to natural disasters.

That is, the former is stuff like having food shelter wealth relationships. The latter is more abstract having to do with if you have low expectations you will rarely be disappointed unhappy with what you receive. In one sense, Maslow's hierarchy of needs could be conceived as twofold the lower levels are the first part of the equation environmental inputs, and the higher levels are more abstract and have to do with mindset. Anecdotally, a very simple and accessible example of this is watching movies. Nowadays I almost always try to go into a movie with low or no expectations I find that it is very good for my contentment. Even with bad movies I don't end up disappointed and am more able to focus on the positives. I also know some people with high expectations for success, and they are often or perpetually unhappy or at least not content with their performance. The problem is balancing this concept of happiness, if one believes that happiness is managing expectations, it is hard to find a middle ground between keeping expectations low and acquiescing fulfilling ambitions goals.

I was a bully as a kid. I would beat kids up, steal their lunch money, shove them into lockers, and dump trash on them, and called them every mean name in the book. I don't regret anything I did, nor do I have any remorse or sympathy for those I bullied. Why? Because quite frankly, I was doing a public service. Kids these days are coddled, self obsessed halfwits. They enter and leave school in both instances completely unprepared for life in the real world, with a complete lack of morals, discipline, and accountability. Students in special ed and diagnosed with autism have exploded in recent years, as kids continue to get special labels placed upon them as their parents protect them or they themselves try to avoid the natural hardships of life, wanting everything to be handed to them just like it was through their child and teenage years. There are two facets to schooling. One of them is obvious, going to class, completing tests and assignments, getting good grades, and learning. The other is more abstract. For most kids, this is the first time they are away from their parents, and the teachers are there to teach, not babysit. The onus is completely upon the student to socialize, make friends, and fit in. For some children, this comes naturally. For others, this can be learned relatively easily. For some, this is an incredible challenge. That's where I came in. I bullied the kids who acted weird and didn't fit in. The ones who sat away from everyone else in lunch. The kids who were picked last in gym. The kids who were loud, obnoxious, and felt like the entire world revolved around them because that was the only life they had ever known. Now, many people assume that bullies are self loathing losers who take out their poor home life and their aggressions on other kids. This could not be further from the truth, in my case. I had a very good family, went on to have a very successful career in law enforcement, and now have a family of my own. As for the kids I went after, I've kept track of most of them. And for the ones that actually stood up to me and fought back to keep a modicum of their self respect, I'm happy to say that many of them are also living successful lives. As for the ones that didn't, sorry to say, it's the exact opposite, with many turning to alcohol, drugs, crime, and even suicide. Now, I'm open to there being other options for school life that are less abrasive, but to be blunt, I don't think they exist. Bullying serves an important purpose, as quite frankly, it separates the wheat from the chaff, creating a clear difference between the self reliant men and the immature boys. And instead of concentrating on why kids bully others, maybe we should look at why these kids are bullied, and figure out ways that they can better stand up for themselves? gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

An executive who can continuously seek re-election is better equalized with the other branches. Fear that a leader somehow will be able to override the checks instituted by the constitution and laws of a state are entirely unfounded. A third-term president in the United States, for example, is no more innately powerful than a second-term one.1 He can no more change the constitution, or take power from the other branches of government than he could previously. In cases where leaders have wrested power from the other branches and become dictators, as in Zimbabwe, the cause of the problem is not a lack of term limits, but rather a lack of adequate separation of powers in government. Term limits do not stop tyranny, as a would-be dictator can easily enough remove term limits by fiat. The solution to dictatorship is the establishment of robust democratic institutions and a genuine separation of powers. Furthermore, a strong leader may be necessary to counter the potential tyranny of a dominant legislature as much as the reverse. Removing term limits ensures balance among the power centres of government. 1 Koenig, Robert. 1995. The Chief Executive.

This will be kind of a hodgepodge of different qualms I have with college frats mainly frats and sororities. Feel free to tackle any or all of them. First, my limited credentials I'm a male who was never in a frat. I started my studies at a local community college after high school, so my first experience with frats happened when I started visiting my old high school friends who went off to study at various colleges across the country. Being freshman and sophomores, one of the big appeals for my particularly female friends was to go to open parties at local frats. All told in the following 3 4 years after graduating high school I probably attended 25 30 of these parties. So while I admit my first hand experience with the Greek system was rather limited to the randier facets of fraternities, I also had many friends, male and female, who were Greek and I would question them about Greek life frequently. And, of course, there's my research on the internet. Now, as to what I saw at those parties Christ. It's hard to put into words. Raunchy? Debauched? Lacking any kind of maturity or mitigating influence? I've been to plenty of awesome non frat parties, but something all of the frat parties I ever attended with the exception of one at San Jose State had in common were irresponsible abandon, lurid sexual behavior, and extreme excess. I should also say that just getting into some of these parties was a pain. Some had strict no non frat males policies obviously that didn't apply to the women , while other maintained ratios, like they'd only allow 1 non Greek guy for every 3 non Greek girls he brought to the party. And even when I did meet these ratio requirements, it wasn't uncommon for a brother to approach me at some point during the event to try and kick me out. Another tactic was to charge males for entrance but let girls in for free, or charge males more than females. Just that fact alone was extremely off putting to me. At the time I was heavily involved in the electronic music scene in the Bay Area, and we never had any kind of gender based admissions policy in regards to none at all, ratios, or fee structures. I also hosted was a planner at several large house parties, and again, no gender based admissions policies. And I also attended college parties in various apartments, dorms, and co ops that didn't have such policies. Frats alone in the college related, private, and public party throwing business were the only hosts who ever maintained such polices which, lets be frank, existed solely to increase the brother's chance of getting laid with minimal competition. If that's one of the main purposes of throwing a party, something is a little slimy in the motivation. And then of course we can talk about what was happening at these parties. Blatant attempts to get mainly college girls absolutely shitfaced. Stupid stunts and displays of bravado. Even by seedy dive bar standards the bathrooms general warranted hazmat gear. Some of the more fucked up things I witnessed included passed out college girls getting carried upstairs towards private bedrooms and DJs jamming to a playlist on a iPod while they pretended to spin. What in the actual fuck is that? We live in the age of Traktor. DJing literally takes no skill nowadays, and you can't even be bothered to master a skill less talent? Now I get that at this point it probably just sounds like I'm bitching about not getting into frat parties. But this segways into my next point Frats are hot beds for sexual assault. It's estimated that sorority girls are 2x more likely to be sexual assault victims than non Greek women. It's estimated that frat brothers are 300 more likely to perpetrate rape than non Greek male students. To be clear, I don't think there's anything inherent about the kind of person who would belong to a frat that makes someone multitudes more likely to be a rapist. Rather, I think it's due to the structure of frats themselves. In frats we have 1 An off campus venue, unlike most dorms. 2 A place where there's no Resident Assistant to mediate things like excessive underage drinking or loud parties late into the night. 3 Frat brothers who are able to legally purchase alcohol for underage brothers and guests to their parties. 4 Access to secluded, locked door bedrooms a short walk away from the party area. 5 A cadre of fellow frat brothers who are more inclined to want to cover up your indiscretions, both out of loyalty and personal interest, than a random dorm mate would be. In other words if you took virtually any college guy and put him in a situation where he's far off campus, has ready access to alcohol which they can provide to female guests , he and female guests can get as wild as they want as late as they want without an RA breaking up the party, has access to private bedrooms just a couple yards away, and has a group of men surrounding him who are more inclined to lie about indiscretions support him if he rapes a chick, I think the chances of virtually any guy perpetrating rape under those circumstances would increase drastically. In fact I'm somewhat surprised it's only 3x higher for frat dudes given all those factors, 10x the rape rate wouldn't seem too far out of bounds. Indeed, perhaps frat brothers are actually exceptionally well behaved and non Greek students are actually the real threat, they only lack the means to pull off their assaults then again, given how many instances we have of frats doing things like Only letting hot women in and then drugging intoxicating them to the point of hospitalization Repeately sexually assaulting college women Offering up guides on how to get women intoxicated before taking advantage of them Just, like, raping a lot Or just chanting rape y slogans as part of an initiation So that might be questionable. Which, Christ, I almost forgot hazing. What the fuck is up with that? Back when I was on an absurdly competitive, Olympic track swim team our hazing of new teammates consisted of waiting until an after practice shower, dismounting the soap dispensers from the wall, taking the lids off, and dumping a few gallons total of shitty pink soap on the poor motherfuckers head at the same time. No harm, no foul. You smelled like generic hotel shampoo for a couple days but hey, at least you were clean. Unlike Greek life, my team's hazing tradition doesn't have a long line of fatalities dating back to the early 1800s, with 40 deaths recorded in the last 10 years, alone And that's just the fatalities nobody can speculate as to the number of awful, degrading, sexually explicit oddly a lot of gay stuff coming from the frats , humiliating, exhausting and, lets be frank, sadistically tortuous hazing activities that have taken place in the last 150 years. Even when it's non life threatening, this stuff gets nasty I recall one of my female friends who pledged and was made to wear only her most unflattering clothing she said some girls had to go buy new shitty clothes since nothing in their wardrobes met the ugly standard , wear no makeup, not shower, and not do anything to their hair for a week of being on campus and as the final indignity, the sorority sisters would circle draw attention to all of their flaws with permanent marker, often labeled e.g. circle a mole on her face with a caption ugly ass mole this bitch usually covers with makeup or an arrow pointing to her nose with a disgusting, big ass nose or even just pointing to a normal mouth with labels like slut mouth. Why??? That's not just good fun, that's fucking cruel, and I don't get why anyone would want to be friends with the tormentors inflicting this kind of thing on them. Now, I don't mean to paint all Greeks with a broad brush, here. I'm sure for those Greeks reading, some of your experiences don't line up with the horrors I witnessed in person or the stats I read on this laptop. Maybe your frat had some joyous, harmless hazing involving a friendly water balloon fight on a summer day. Maybe your frat had a strict nobody gets served if they're underage or looks intoxicated policy. Maybe your frat was just as welcoming of strange dudes coming into your house as random hot chicks. I'm sure those frats exist, and in fact in my experience with 25 30 of them I can attest at least one such frat exists they were really chill they gave me a beer as soon as I entered and let me DJ later that night , but I don't think any of us can deny at least some significant facet of Greek life has its perils. Given this, I'm always baffled that Greek houses are tied with colleges at all. Look, your business is your business, and if you want to buy out a house and charge college students for rent on the rooms and call yourself some nonsensical Greek or Roman or Latvian or Pig Latin name, that's your thing, man. You do you. But why do colleges associate with these organizations? Because they do charity work sometimes and teach young men how to tie a tie? So what? That's nice and all, but is that benefit worth associating with organizations at, at least most of the time, seem more preoccupied with binge drinking and rape? Colleges are constantly having to disavow themselves from Greek houses mainly frats because of this kind of behavior. Why not just drop the whole thing altogether? What are the colleges getting out of this arrangement? As a final, more minor aside, I'm aware some Greek houses actually maintain their own house grounds keeping services. Like there's a dedicated maid, cook, gardener, etc. If the whole point of these institutions is to teach young people how to deal with being an adult, having a maid who will come through every morning to clean up all the empty Keystone cans and errant female underwear is not a benefit to that goal. Which is one of the reasons I've always admired co ops, who will welcome virtually anyone off the street so long as they put in their fair share. Now look, I do get that Greek organizations are not all born equal. One of my friends belonged to a frat that consisted of like a dozen Jewish guys who all just liked smoking weed and listening to Zepplin on their Friday nights, and by day they engaged in many of the beneficial activities I mentioned earlier. Great. Good for them. If they want to do that on their own time, fine. But why do colleges need to associate with them to make this possible? Nobody is stopping any group from doing charity work just for not being tied to a college. Indeed, as a hiring manager, if you put down was involved in X charity, I like that, because it means something clear if you put down member of Greek letter Greek letter Greek letter , that means nothing to me. It could just as easily mean I worked with charities as it could I spent my weekend fucking off and preying on drunk co eds. In short, I've come to dislike the Greek system. It might have been a noble institution back in the day, but in modern times it's become a focus point for everything that's wrong with the bro valleygirl stereotypes. It's where the Chads and Stacys of the world come to play. Greeks might take pride in their association with these groups, but when such association is mentioned to the rest of us terms like hazing and rape and binge drinking come to mind far before any laudable labels like hard working, charity promoting individual. Anyways. I feel there's something I'm just not getting about these places, and what my Greek friends have tried to convey about the experience my own firsthand experience and internet research just doesn't add up to me getting it. I mean, colleges are full of academic types, right? There must be some good reason for associating with these houses, but from where I'm standing the benefit just doesn't seem to outweigh the cost. Ya'll know what to do. Cheers. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

The U.S. \u201chealth care cost crisis\u201d didn\u2019t start until 1965. The government increased demand with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid while restricting the supply of doctors and hospitals. Health care prices responded at twice the rate of inflation Source Now, the U.S. is repeating the same mistakes with the unveiling of Obamacare a.k.a. \u201cMedicare and Medicaid for the middle class\u201d . Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman wrote that medical price inflation since 1965 has been caused by the rising demand for health care coupled with restricted supply. Robert Alford explained the minority view The market reformers wish to preserve the control of the individual physician over his practice, over the hospital, and over his fees, and they simply wish to open up the medical schools in order to meet the demand for doctors, to give patients more choice among doctors, clinics, and hospitals, and to make that choice a real one by public subsidies for medical bills . The majority of policymakers support either monopolization e.g. typically Republicans or nationalization e.g., typically Democrats . Both have claimed physician supply can create its own demand, which means increasing the supply of doctors and hospitals will just motivate them to convince ignorant consumers to order more unnecessary and expensive health care. During the 1970s, Frank Sloan, a Vanderbilt University health care economist, explained the success of the most influential pro regulation health care economist, Uwe Reinhardt His theories are highly regarded because he is so clearly understood. Unfortunately the evidence for them is not good it is not bad either, it is just not there. And it would be a shame to see federal policy set on such a poor, unscientific basis. Since the early 1900s, medical special interests have been lobbying politicians to reduce competition. By the 1980s, the U.S. was restricting the supply of physicians, hospitals, insurance and pharmaceuticals, while subsidizing demand. Since then, the U.S. has been trying to control high costs by moving toward something perhaps best described by the House Budget Committee \u201cIn too many areas of the economy \u2014 especially energy, housing, finance, and health care \u2014 free enterprise has given way to government control in \u201cpartnership\u201d with a few large or politically well connected companies\u201d. The following are past major laws and other policies implemented by the Federal and state governments that have interfered with the health care marketplace HHS 2013 In 1910, the physician oligopoly was started during the Republican administration of William Taft after the American Medical Association lobbied the states to strengthen the regulation of medical licensure and allow their state AMA offices to oversee the closure or merger of nearly half of medical schools and also the reduction of class sizes. The states have been subsidizing the education of the number of doctors recommended by the AMA. In 1925, prescription drug monopolies begun after the federal government led by Republican President Calvin Coolidge started allowing the patenting of drugs. Drug monopolies have also been promoted by government research and development subsidies targeted to favored pharmaceutical companies. In 1945, buyer monopolization begun after the McCarran Ferguson Act led by the Roosevelt Administration exempted the business of medical insurance from most federal regulation, including antitrust laws. States have also more recently contributed to the monopolization by requiring health care plans to meet standards for coverage. In 1946, institutional provider monopolization begun after favored hospitals received federal subsidies matching grants and loans provided under the Hospital Survey and Construction Act passed during the Truman Administration. States have also been exempting non profit hospitals from antitrust laws. In 1951, employers started to become the dominant third party insurance buyer during the Truman Administration after the Internal Revenue Service declared group premiums tax deductible. In 1965, nationalization was started with a government buyer monopoly after the Johnson Administration led passage of Medicare and Medicaid which provided health insurance for the elderly and poor, respectively. In 1972, institutional provider monopolization was strengthened after the Nixon Administration started restricting the supply of hospitals by requiring federal certificate of need for the construction of medical facilities. In 1974, buyer monopolization was strengthened during the Nixon Administration after the Employee Retirement Income Security Act exempted employee health benefit plans offered by large employers e.g., HMOs from state regulations and lawsuits e.g., brought by people denied coverage . In 1984, prescription drug monopolies were strengthened during the Reagan Administration after the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act permitted the extension of patents beyond 20 years. The government has also allowed pharmaceuticals companies to bribe physicians to prescribe more expensive drugs. In 2003, prescription drug monopolies were strengthened during the Bush Administration after the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act provided subsidies to the elderly for drugs. In 2014, nationalization will be strengthened after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \u201cObamacare\u201d provided mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges, and the expansion of Medicaid. The history of medical cost inflation and government interference in health care markets appears to support the hypothesis that prices were set by the laws of supply and demand before 1980 and perhaps 1990. Even the degree of monopolization and nationalization promoted by politicians before 1965 was not enough to cause significant cost inflation and spending increases until demands created by Medicare and Medicaid outstripped the restricted supply of physicians and hospitals. Spending on prescription drugs didn\u2019t accelerate until after pharmaceutical monopolies were strengthened in 1984. Spending has increased even less for administrative, net cost of private health insurance and nursing home care, and not much at all for dental, structures, equipment, public health, other personal and professional care, home health care, research, non prescription drugs and durable medical equipment. Since the 1980s, the government has used its buyer monopoly power, through its Medicare and Medicaid programs, to effectively set price and quality controls e.g., underpayments on physicians and hospitals. For the same purpose, the Federal and state governments promoted the concentration of private insurance into buyer monopolies e.g., HMOs . The government has also encouraged clinics and hospitals to respond by merging into concentrated provider monopolies while continuing to limit the supply of doctors and hospitals . These government private partnerships called managed competition resemble centrally planned fascism. Government sets prices, which has predictably led to reduced quality, rationing and other perverse gaming. Moreover, the bureaucracy has brought standardized care, higher administrative costs and high executive salaries. Although costs have continued to rise at the same double the rate of inflation, it is questionable the extent to which prices are now set by the laws of supply and demand. Obamacare is expected to expand coverage by about 22 million people with subsidies and another 17 million through Medicaid. Regardless how the current problems with mandates play out, demand will likely skyrocket without increasing supply proportionately. Higher prices and costs and or lower quality can be expected to result in calls for nationalization e.g., \u201csingle payer\u201d by Democrats while Republicans counter with private insurance and tort reforms. The search for alternative economic systems should include free markets through a closer reexamination of the health care marketplace before 1980 to 1990 to determine whether prices offered by physicians and hospitals were ever set by the laws of supply and demand. To quote the great economic expositor Henry Hazlitt, gt Prices are fixed through the relationship of supply and demand. When people want more of an article, they offer more for it. The price goes up. This increases the profits of those who make the article. Because it is now more profitable to make that article than others, the people already in the business expand their production of it, and more people are attracted to the business. This increased supply then reduces the price. The structure of the following argument will follow the Hazlitt quote. 1 Prices are fixed through the relationship of supply and demand Medicare and Medicaid spending as part of total U.S. healthcare spending as percent of gross domestic product. In 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare and Medicaid programs See link directly above . From 1966 to 1980, Medicare provided health insurance for about 20 million elderly. By 1980, Medicaid was covering about 12 million poor people. M. Stanton Evans claimed that by dumping demand into our medical system, these government programs bid up all the factors of supply Other factors that also contributed to an escalation in demand for physician and hospital services before and after 1965 have included a growing and later aging population, rising personal incomes, private health insurance, breakthroughs by the American drug industry, and advances in electronic and mechanical devices. Unmet demand for physician services have persisted in rural and poor urban areas, preventive care, geriatrics, house calls, cost management, computerized medicine, entrepreneurism, medical supply, environmental, public health services, mental institutions, prisons, drug programs, and military and foreign service. Physician services became the number one growth industry. Health care industry experts agree that the major service provided by the health care industry is rendered or overseen by physicians. Protected by licensure laws from competition by non physicians, physicians control an estimated 80 percent of all health care expenses, including 70 percent of hospital costs. While some proposed reforms for reducing excessive demand have merit, their unpopularity has only served as an excuse to delay a supply response. Some have blamed government for subsidizing health care, and call for taxing employee benefits and even eliminating government programs. Others have blamed the unhealthy living habits of consumers, but it has proved difficult trying to deny them the freedom to choose how to live their life. Between 1965 and 1980, it is unlikely physicians and hospitals were creating their own demand since they were busy meeting the additional demands created by government. In addition, patients subsidized by Medicare remained concerned purchasers that spent an average of 20 percent of their income on medical care, including purchasing insurance. Many blame third party insurance for making consumers less accountable for spending. But consumers seek to spread risk by purchasing health coverage from third party payers. Moreover, third party insurance existed long before the health care cost crisis Number of people with employer provided health insurance 1940 to 1960 Since the 1930s, hospital groups like Blue Cross and physician groups like Blue Shield had been offering fee for care insurance programs to employers, who then offered them to their employees for premiums. The non profit Kaiser Permanente contracted with companies to meet all of the medical needs of employees for premiums. A free competitive market can still exist with third party payment. Consumers want the most benefits for the lowest health care premiums and also want to limit employee wages assigned to health care coverage. Insurance companies and self insured employers want to pay the lowest amount possible to physicians and hospitals. If the health care industry was indeed competitive at all supply levels, suppliers would aggressively offer insurers competitive prices for high quality services. Insurers would have no trouble selecting health care policies for their policyholders that encouraged them to obtain the best service they could for the lowest cost. Consumers would protect themselves from unethical providers by taking their business to those who had a good reputation for quality work at reasonable prices without unnecessary services. In a competitive market, providers are forced to obtain this reputation or they go out of business. The supply and demand curves are both price inelastic, as illustrated by mostly vertical plots Illustration of a Price Inelastic Demand Increase to Higher Price for Health Care The demand for physician care is a classic example of a necessity with no close substitutes i.e., licensing restrictions prevent substitutions from non physician practitioners . The price elasticity of demand is only 0.31 for medical insurance. This means the quantity that consumers demand will not change much with changes in price or the method of financing i.e., people will pay whatever they can . The supply curve is also price inelastic and not very responsive to price because physicians require many years of training. Since 1965, the demand curve has shifted toward more quantity demanded at each price. For example, the equilibrium point as shifted from E1,1 to E2,1. Since the supply and demand curves are price inelastic, increases in demand are amplified into larger increases in medical prices. 2 The price goes up. This increases the profits of those who make the article. Since 1965, medical prices have exploded with physician fees, see An indexed comparison of inflation of total medical prices and physician services from 1950 to 1993 with 1950 base year From 1965 through 1993, the price for medical care increased by 699 and physician fees 675 compared to only 359 for all goods and services measured in the Consumer Price Index. Today, medical prices and physician fees continue to grow at about twice the rate of inflation. Hospital prices have increased at almost four times. U.S. health care spending has increased from 6 of the Gross Domestic Product in 1965 to 18 3 trillion today. Jay Winsten of the Harvard School of Public Health wrote The solution lies in examining the forces driving the medical care delivery system. This examination must focus on physicians . Economist Lawrence Baker reported that HMOs aren't achieving their goal of increasing the efficiency of the delivery of medical services because physicians have too much market power for the development of competition. Cost control incentives encouraged by competition for clients has been limited in health care because client demands have grown more than physician supply since 1965. Even when physicians work for health institutions like hospitals, physician number can limit the volume of patient care rendered and thus the extent to which competition for patients occurs between institutions. In the absence of competition, not only physician fees but prices for every element of health care that physicians control inflated because there was little incentive to efficiently manage costs. The highly paid and hurried work week has reduced cost saving and quality improving innovative incentives placed on physicians. The lack of competition between hospitals and other health care institutions also limited cost control incentives placed on executives. The lack of competition between both medical institutions and the doctors that control most of their spending could explain why hospital costs have been inflating twice as fast as even physician fees. Hospitals are loaded with waste and inefficiency. For example, a hospital stitch costs more than 500 today. Health care may be the only industry in which suppliers blame technology for high costs. But researchers at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reported that small medical expenses controlled by physicians, such as blood tests and ordinary x rays, were responsible for medical inflation, not complex technologies. The article stated that if the annual operating costs of the nation's more complex technologies \u2014 kidney dialysis, coronary bypass, electronic fetal monitoring, and computerized x rays \u2014 were reduced one half, the net savings would be less than one percent of the nations medical bill. They proposed income incentives for physicians as motivation for cost control. Some market opponents disputed that a free market could create competition since they claim a surplus of doctors in some medical fields and geographic areas had not brought price competition. However, evidence of this is limited to secondary care physicians, such as surgeons. Secondary care physicians, who derive more of their patient load from referrals, cannot compete on the basis of price unless the primary care physicians, that refer patients to them, are under competition to care about costs. Few primary care physicians would refer a patient to a physician taking aggressive price cutting steps because they would be viewed as rocking the boat. The higher paid secondary care physicians may experience some unemployment before a competitive surplus of primary care physicians can develop. Geographic studies involving cities with a surplus supply are based on physician to population ratios and do not take into account the fact that demand may be much higher in the cities. The collapse of demand during economic downturns has provided evidence that physicians cannot create their own demand. The AMA had to respond to low physician incomes caused by the Great Depression by cutting medical school admissions and not creating their own demand . During another temporary decrease in demand caused by the severe recession during the early 1980s, the Wall Street Journal reported good news, however to free market advocates, who note that in a few cities price wars have cut medical costs doctors are also alarmed by the increasing number of physicians fear they won't be able to compete with other doctors . 3 The people already in the business expand their production of it. The increase in demand allowed physicians to expand their practices to serve more patients. Since physicians actually worked a few hours less per week, the increased number of patients received far less attention and quality deteriorated. In 1972, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that, The average patient load and the average volume of units of patient care for the average physician has increased dramatically in the last five to six years. Medicare, Medicaid and the increased coverage of medical and hospital insurance have produced a skyrocketing rise in effective demand for medical services the demand could be met only by the existing number of physicians providing more units of patient care. They claimed the doctor shortage had increased the possibility of the kind of breakdown in the patient doctor relationship that can lead to a lawsuit. Overworked practitioners have been rendering hurried, poor quality medical care, dangerously understaffed hospitals and medical facilities, waiting lines, and 36 hour shifts squeezed into 120 hour work weeks by many residents at hospitals. Many doctors have freely admitted to being too busy healing to keep abreast of new techniques and research ideas. It has been suggested that the long, hurried work week of physicians contributed to the high incidences of fatigue, depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicide among doctors. The lack of competition has failed to drive out the estimated five percent of the physicians considered unfit to practice medicine. Recently, Harvard University's Lucian Leape has estimated there are approximately 120,000 accidental deaths and 1,000,000 injuries in U.S. hospitals every year. The physician's lack of time to communicate effectively depersonalized care. The Wall Street Journal reported, Many doctors concede that the increasingly impersonal tone of medical care makes bringing a malpractice claim easier . In 1994, a study reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that doctors could reduce the chances of being sued for malpractice by not acting rushed or being impersonal with patients. The consumer revolt to the quality deterioration was dubbed the malpractice crisis. While the total dollars spent on health care in the United States increased about 100 from 1966 to 1972, malpractice insurance increased 400 for all physicians and 425 for surgeons Higher rates were a response to increased losses by insurance companies. For example, Aetna's indemnity losses for both doctor and hospital malpractice suits in the United States went from 300,000 to 9.5 million per year between 1965 and 1968, respectively. Malpractice Report Lawyers Sylvia Law and Steven Polan claimed, Doctors are primarily responsible A consultant to the American Hospital Association reported in 1976 that hospital personnel controllable claims, such as burns, medication mistake, and blood transfusion error, were remaining relatively stable, but physician controllable claims were increasing rapidly. They add, In the enormous quantity of research and literature generated by the malpractice crisis there is not a shred of hard evidence suggesting that the injuries of successful claimants resulted from anything other than avoidable medical negligence . To protect themselves against malpractice suits, physicians claimed they were practicing \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d by desperately ordering more and expensive tests and procedures for patients performed by other paramedical personnel. Polls have shown a majority will also protect each other by refusing to testify against other doctors in lawsuits. Those who have claimed the laws of supply and demand do not apply to health care have noticed that as doctors are added, prices do not decrease. They sometimes fail to consider that doctors can expand their services by spending more time on each patient and restoring quality rather than competing for clients based on price. One problem is that the consumer price index used by economists to measure the rate of inflation cannot measure quality. After 1965, prices for comparable quality likely rose faster than that measured by economists. After 1972, an increase in the annual number of newly licensed physicians meant more demand was met and the attention to patients was likely being restored. During the 1980s, the malpractice crisis began to level off. Still, the U.S. has \u201clowest life expectancy, at 78.2 years\u201d among developed countries. 4 More people are attracted to the business. This increases supply then reduces price. As the laws of supply and demand would predict, the number of medical school applicants have consistently responded to increases in the demand for physician services and fees In the seven years from 1967 to 1974 the number of medical school applicants for a given year increased by 127 compared to only 35 for the seven years from 1960 to 1967. Today, medical school applicants are at an all time high of over 48,000, as increases in physician fees remain at twice the rate of inflation. But the U.S. failed to allow physician supply to respond to meet consumer demand. From 1965 through 1972 the number of newly licensed U.S. physicians graduated each year from medical schools in the United States and Canada increased from 7455 to 7815 or by only 360 physicians From 1972 through 1980, this amount gradually doubled but the medical schools became even more restrictive as they annually rejected about 20,000 qualified applicants who tried to fill the unmet demand Today, medical schools are rejecting 28,000 applicants. The doubling in the number of licenses meant a mere 3.5 annual increase in the 418,000 total physicians in 1980. Since much of the increase in medical school acceptances since 1965 has been necessary just to keep up with the increased level of demand, only a fraction of the increase in enrollment has gone toward filling the shortage or back log of doctors created by the 1965 crisis. If only 10 of annual physician output fills this back log, a further doubling in the output would achieve competition eleven times faster. In 1980, the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare said there was no clear analysis showing whether health care costs would be reduced if the nation achieved a surplus of physicians because we have never lived in an excess supply situation so we don't have a model that would give us an answer. Medical schools have been rejecting applicants that could have increased the existing quality of doctors. The average rejected applicant of 1975 had higher Medical College Admissions Test scores than the average accepted applicant of 1955 on the same test that was replaced in the 1970s . In the early 1980s, the handbook of the Association of American Medical Colleges stated that the number of qualified applicants from the United States alone is over twice the number of places available. Admission remains so competitive today that only the very top students even bother to apply for limited places and most are rejected in a selection process that involves significant cronyism. Meanwhile, the U.S. has granted medical licenses to the 25 percent of all doctors practicing in the United States that were educated abroad, often at inferior schools. The states allow the AMA to control total enrollment at medical schools by allowing them to determine the number of medical schools, the cost of medical education, and the amount of subsidies. The subsidies needed for medical education has been used as an excuse for rejecting qualified applicants. But the high cost of medical education was grossly inflated by a more than doubling in the ratio of faculty to students, and faculty salaries that dwarf the salaries of other professors made only necessary by the need to lure physicians from an overly lucrative medical market . Moreover, total medical school subsidies are insignificant compared to the money lost by an uncompetitive market. Milton Friedman wrote that physicians prevent health care competition by limiting the number of entrants into the profession. Another Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Samuelson of MIT wrote Because the demand for medical care is price inelastic, restricting the number of medical students raises the price of medical care and increases the incomes of doctors\u201d Market opponents have not only claimed there are too many doctors but also too many hospital beds. In 1972, the federal government started restricting the supply of hospitals with certificate of need followed by repeal of the Hospital Survey and Construction Act in 1974 . Alaska House of Representatives member Bob Lynn argued the true motivation was large hospitals are trying to make money by eliminating competition under the pretext of using monopoly profits to provide better patient care. From 1965 to 1989, the number of hospital beds and occupied beds per population declined by 44 and 15 percent, respectively. Today, the U.S. and Canada have less than 25 doctors and 30 hospital beds per 10,000 population , compared to over 35 and 50, respectively, in most countries in continental Western Europe. Mark Pearson, head of Division on Health Policy at The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD , discussed possible reasons the U.S. spends more than two and a half times per person more than most developed nations in the world, including relatively rich European countries \u201cThe U.S. has fewer physicians and fewer physician consultations relative to its population. The U.S. also has fewer hospital beds for its population size and shorter average stays in hospital relative to other countries. Indeed, the lower numbers of physicians could help explain why they cost more there is less competition for patients.\u201d He adds that universities in other countries are still able to attract the best students to medicine. The U.S. health care market appears to behave according to laws of supply and demand at least until the 1980s . Assuming government subsidy of the elderly and poor serves the public good, the cause of the \u201cU.S. health care cost crisis\u201d appears to be that government didn\u2019t allow the supply of doctors and hospitals to respond to increased consumer demands. Politicians from both major political parties created a self fulfilling prophesy by assuming markets couldn\u2019t work in health care. The obvious solution is to increase the supply of physicians and hospitals to meet demand. Unfortunately, if medical schools doubled their class sizes by next year, it could still take over 20 years to achieve the number of doctors relative to population found in continental Western Europe. Competition could be achieved quicker by relaxing the licensing requirements placed on para medicals e.g. nurses , and possibly also foreign educated doctors, to compete with U.S. physicians to the degree to which they are qualified. If Obamacare is still necessary, the additional demands created by subsidizing even more consumers will require even more supply. Regardless, all major health care policies implemented by the U.S. government after 1965 will likely need to be repealed and the \u201cplaying field\u201d leveled so new entrants can compete against previously subsidized and now entrenched providers. Supply and demand graphs can illustrate the supply shift needed to balance the demand shift since 1965 Once consumer demand for quality has been satisfied, the supply shift will result in more quantity of medical care supplied, greater access to medical care, lower prices, increased efficiency and real growth. By the definition of price inelastic demand, total medical expenditures must decrease e.g., from spending area I to II . During the past 48 years, the U.S. has paid a heavy price for denying potential competitors entry into the health care marketplace. The nation has likely wasted the equivalent of nearly two trillion dollars per year in 2012 dollars . The costs are bankrupting the country as the leading contributor to the 16 trillion national debt through spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security . Health care is also the number one barrier to America's global competitiveness according to Edward Deming , and the largest contributor to financial stress and personal bankruptcies.

Any system that charges a person so much money for it legitimate necessary medical care, procedures or preventative medicine that it causes them financial distress and or bankruptcy is wrong and immoral.

A moral action would have no affect, or a positive affect on others as a whole. An immoral action would have a negative affect on others as a whole. I'm aware that there are scenarios where you could argue that something that's typically considered immoral would actually be moral in this framework killing Hitler's mother before he was born, for example and those are fantastic conversations but irrelevant for this  so I won't be entertaining them.

The leftist solution is to increase the public spending to keep the economy going. It'd help us for few years but if our exports don't increase then we'll basically be in same situation as Greece. If we only had markka we could devaluate it and increase the competitiveness of our exports. But since we're in eurozone we can't do that.

So it's not like it gets exponentially hotter because it's hot outside.

Which causes an extremely satisfying cool feeling when you step out of the bathroom even if it's like 90 degrees. After the sauna like conditions which in itself isn't even bad feeling no matter what the temperature is outside it will be refreshingly cool feeling. If you take a cold shower, it might cool you off for the moment but it doesn't make the outside air feel comparatively cooler.

First, let me define immoral for the purposes of this discussion. immoral is anything that major religions would find wrong , but they do not directly harm anyone e.g. marijuana, gay marriage, consensual polygamy, etc. I am not arguing for the subjective objective truth here i.e. i'm not arguing whether something is wrong , just the legality of things. So i think that these things should not necessarily be illegal as it is not the government's job to arbitrate social values. It is their job to give their citizens equal chances in life, and to maintain civil order. If, for example, a population feels like banning gay marriage would keep civil order, then it should be done. Otherwise, they should not. Likewise for the opposing view. It is then up to activists and civil leaders to persuade the population that their stance is the best. Also, having the government single handedly determine what's right or wrong can be a messy business. For example, just look at the American government's fight in marijuana legalization, where states have already made it legal, but the federal government is tightening its grip on the substance. America is a land where many people might hold opposing viewpoints, but i do agree that we should uphold the law regardless of our personal convictions. The question then becomes how do we set laws?

What I mean when I say this is that I believe in general, they have an easier time finding employment, making friends, and are respected more. What I define as success is achieving happiness in friendship, relationships, and acquiring self confidence. I believe that physically attractive people have an easier time achieving this sort of success for the following reasons 1 Many industries hire people based on attractiveness. I'm not talking about hygiene. I'm talking about what society such as Western society considers attractive. For women, society generally considers slimness, long eyelashes, and thicker lips attractive. For men, it is defined muscle tone and a defined jawline. Many companies hire attractive women and sometimes men in order to boost traffic in stores. 2 Attractive people tend to make friends easier. Is this because they have higher self confidence? Or is it because society is naturally gravitated towards physical attraction? I think both. But I think that the first is a result of the second. 3 My opinion has been formed based on my own personal experiences. I have posted my picture on the r RateMe subreddit through a throw away account, of course and have received an average or a 6.5 10. So I'm not too attractive, but also not too unattractive. I am not posting this  out of frustration that I am not a 8 or 9 10. Rather, I'm very interested to hear what others think.

I believe that the corporate income tax should be completely eliminated, as well as all corporate tax loopholes. The main problem with corporate income tax is that it's economically inefficient. It should be replaced with more efficient forms of taxation like a land value tax or a carbon tax. To be clear, I think that any change in the tax code should be revenue neutral. American workers would stand to benefit greatly if we eliminated the tax. Eliminating the tax would lead to a huge short run inflow of capital, raising the United States\u2019 capital stock machines and buildings by 23 percent, output by 8 percent, and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent.

Sugary, fatty food is so much cheaper then healthier meals. Think about it, look at any grocery store. Fresh, lean meats and fresh vegetables especially organic are ungodly expensive. Meanwhile, you can get sweets, prepackaged food and processed food for only a couple bucks. Think about it, being a very poor person or maybe someone who recieves SNAP benefits, with very little money to spend on food has to ration their money and make it last a month. Seriously, have you ever noticed that in general it's usually poorer people who are overweight and more wealthy people are thinner Another good example is McDonald's and other fast food places. It's a quick solution for people who have very little time to cook, but you can buy a burger for literally 1 dollar. The grilled chicken sandwich costs around 5, and a salad costs about 6 or 7.

Killed someone by throwing rocks at them? Death by stoning. Killed by shooting? Criminal should be shot. Thieves should lose all their property, rapists should be raped. This may be an extreme form of justice, but I believe it is one of the only just system. You see completely sick, sadistic cruel people, that only get punished by being behind bars? For example people like Ariel Castro. He kidnapped 3 innocent girls, trapped them, beat them, starved them, raped and impregnated them and made them have miscarriages for 11 years. 11 whole years. A complete monster. But what is his punishment? Lifetime in prison? Do you really think life in prison is the just punishment for that? The same punishment which would be applied to a man committing first degree murder? It's ridiculous IMO. Intuitively, surely you would believe a man like that deserves more than simply life in prison. And in reality, all he did was SERVE ONE MONTH and hang himself. Death by hanging is NOTHING compared to what he did, he doesn't deserve death by the rope. I believe everything he did, should be done to him. Of course he can't get impregnated, but there should be a procedure where punishments should be somewhat adjusted and equivalent. For example, he would be trapped and chained also for 11 years, and continuously raped and starved. Of course, you may think this is equally sick and doesn't do any good at all. But I am willing to sacrifice our humanity if it means punishing a monster that committed acts of no humanity at all. Maybe if monsters like him knew that their acts would have equal weight in punishment to them, they would be in fear rather than laugh at how simple their punishments will be anyway. A second choice would be that families affected by the crime should be able to decide the course of action for the criminal. I think this may be more fair. Families are the ones who would be most affected by crimes, most hurt. Therefore I think they have the right to decide the punishment for the criminal in context. The action they decide cannot be worse than what the criminal did, only equivalent or lower. For example, a thief cannot be decided to be raped by a family. A rapist cannot be forced to be burnt to death by the family, only raped. However, im not saying families can choose lower punishments e.g a murderer being punched in the face as this would be a complex thing to decide. EDIT SLIGHT VIEW CHANGE I think families can choose lower punishments, the method to do so would be complex and time consuming however. But it is an opportunity cost I would be willing to take. This may involve court measures and the family, lawyers, judge and jury deciding the form of 'lower punishment' done to the criminal, and whether it truly is 'lower' in an ethical sense Therefore when I say families should choose, they can only choose a punishment of equal weigh, or decide to forgive the criminal.

The example from voting The best argument I have for defending my choice not to vote is that my decision will have a near zero statistically insignificant effect on policy. The usual rebuttal is that if everyone thinks like that it will have a big effect . This may be true, but I am not responsible for other people's decisions of whether or not to vote and so the rebuttal is mute. The example from veganism As a consumer of meat, I am responsible only for my decision to consume the flesh of an already dead animal. There is no moral problem with consuming the flesh of a dead animal for my nutrition. Vegans will usually point out the well known fact that the meat industry involves many horrifying externalities, but that argument is mute since the relevant decisions made by others, not me, and I am only responsible for my decision, with which there is nothing wrong. As a consumer I am not responsible for managing market externalities nor the business practices of producers. A final hypothetical example from the pub If I encourage someone to drive home in spite of them being intoxicated, I am in no way guilty of drunken driving should the person decide to drive under the influence, nor am I responsible for any harm that may result from that decision. The responsibility for drunken driving, possible civil charges and even manslaughter lays squarely on the shoulders of the drunken driver himself. Exclusions I think some vicarious liability makes sense for employers and legal guardians. A supervisor may be held responsible to a certain extent for the decisions of their subordinates and legal guardians may be held responsible to a certain extent for the decisions of their children or the disabled people under their care. JUSTIFICATION Now that I've clarified what I mean, I will put forward two justifications administrative burden and decision making burden. Administrative burden It is already a huge and to a large extend an overwhelming legal administrative burden to hold natural persons accountable for their own decisions. Far fewer court cases would ever be settled if it was required that in addition to the main culprits, every person who had a direct or indirect influence on the decision of the culprit should be identified and held accountable. Decision making burden It is already a huge and to a large extend an overwhelming burden on individuals' reasoning capacity to figure out how to make ethical decisions considering only their immediate utility. Requiring individuals to also consider all the direct and indirect influences they have on the decisions of others is requiring the impossible and therefor is unreasonable.

I'm sorry, but I frankly have to disagree with the points Mr. Yianoppolis outlines here. A few points I'd like to contest Net Neutrality did not start under Obama. The term was coined by the FCC in 2007 and described in detail after Comcast slowed P2P clients indiscriminately to clarify their policies on internet service regulations up to that point. Due to virtual monopolies and outright lies in cases like the 2007 Comcast case and a plethora of others, it is very easy to see that the free market was unable to manage the principles of net neutrality or even at a minimum a free and open internet. Corporations can, will, and have agreed on their own interests, both commercially and in some cases politically. Again, the idea that net neutrality wouldn't work implies that it never did, which is easily proven false by the FCC acting on violations of the principles outlined both previously and post the 2007 Comcast incident. The FCC had said as early at 1998 that that they did not wish to regulate the internet under Title II and did not want to interfere with the free market enterprise of internet service providers. The reason for limited regulatory action under Title II was due to the 2014 lawsuit by Verizon in which it was deemed that they could not act on these regulations unless they determined ISPs to be regulated under Title II, which was why under the Obama Administration in 2015 this action was taken. To reiterate the previous statements about limited regulatory action under Title II, the FCC specifically outlined exactly what small portions of Title II apply to ISPs acting as utilities, dissociation to avoid limiting the tailored service you describe. This is not about government interference in an industry, this is about ensuring honest business practices within an industry that has repeatedly proven it will act in such a nefarious and deceptive manner, which the free market cannot correct for to the widespread use of these practices and virtual monopolies in which the majority of citizens have a choice of two or fewer broadband ISPs. So then, where do I stand? I believe net neutrality has proven to be the only way to ensure the continuation of a free and fair internet. Comcast, Verizon, and other corporations have proven through their service that they can and will abuse and lie to their consumers, utilizing anti competitive practices to funnel money toward their own self serving interests. Title II regulations are merely a side effect of the right, and are required to properly and legally regulate ISPs. Without Title II, the FCC has not regulatory authority over ISPs only congress will. As such, limited use of Title II is a necessary vehicle toward ensuring the maintenance of Net Neutrality. Rebuttals are welcome, and I would love to have a conversation about this because I find these issues to be essential to managing the interaction between the economy, politics, and the government, especially regarding what role the government should play in regulating industry. The core question becomes for me, where is regulation necessary and how do we prevent it from being overbearing, especially in small businesses and private citizens? I honestly don't know, but I think Net Neutrality brings the issue to the forefront and outlines an area where the free market could potentially fail at corporate regulation."}, {"conclusion": "Taking oral contraception is wrong, esp. in a marriage", "id": 109396, "argument": "Human life is substantially good 2. an intentional action whose nature is to maintain the existence of human life is good and right 3.

I've read numerous articles from the time I was about 13 14 until now. This is my educated opinion based on what I've read. I'm only talking about actual scientific articles and not tumblr bullshit articles. I think that hormone blockers are great and should be used if someone wants them. On the other hand, I don't think that hormones should be used at that age. Some studies have been done that say up to 1 5 of transgender people regret their transition. That is insanely high, but due to the low percentage of the population that is actually transgender 1 300 people and the short amount of time it's been studied, it is hard to know how accurate this is. One of the main reasons I've been afraid to actually start doing anything myself is due to statistics like these. I also believe that it is hard to explain the risks to a younger teen. Both ftm and mtf hormones lead to an increased risk in heart problems and other possible side effects. They also can make you infertile and the changes in some cases aren't reversible if you've been on them a long time. When I was 14, I thought as soon as I was 18 I was going to go to a doctor and start the process. Now knowing and understanding the risks, I have yet to see a gender therapist. Your teens are a time of exploration and really figuring yourself out. I still don't have myself figured out. I know some people figure themselves out sooner than others and that's great. I just don't think that teens younger than 16 should be allowed to medically transition and they should have to be diagnosed with gender disphoria. Gender disphoria is the hate and discomfort that a transgender person feels about their body. In most cases, it is treated by transitioning. Interesting though is that some cases go away with age around or before age 30. This seems to be pretty uncommon, but I believe it is worth mentioning. I don't understand the point of transitioning if you don't have gender disphoria. It isn't medically necessary and it is more likely for you to regret your transition if you don't have it. Many people who appear to be going along with the trend of transgenderism say they don't have to have gender disphoria to transition. It's concerns me that they say this because I don't want people who are going to be unhappy transitioning to transition. It could possibly make it harder for transgender people to transition in the future if a large number of people choose to detransition or commit suicide. Over all, it's probably best for someone to speak to their doctor. Be a better person than I am.

I think inciting violence is ethically wrong. I think it's bad to do. I think you shouldn't do it. I also think this obvious disclaimer will probably be lost on some people, but here it is. Anyway, the Western world likes to have its cake and eat it too with free speech. We like to engage in this disgusting virtue signaling, especially when comparing ourselves to our, ahem, barbaric neighbors. We insist that we're in love with this whole free speech thing, because freedom is good and God, here in the West, don't we just like freedom? Of course, and completely predictably, this resolve to uphold the freedom of expression tends to crumble at the slightest provocation. There are two key places, I think, where our alleged freedom of speech fails in the West. First, primarily at the hands of the Left, we have begun to decide that people have an inherent right not to be offended or be exposed to anything that dares question their delicate sensibilities. This is a topic for another day. The other place, the one I'd like to talk about, is that we've long since decided that inciting violence is totally uncool, guys. Let's start with the most superficial argument. We say we love free speech, but then go right around and say you're not free to incite violence. Regardless of whether you like violence or not, the immediate contradiction arises that our idea of free speech isn't free at all. Either our speech is free, or it isn't. Free speech very obviously implies a lack of exceptions. If I'm not free to say x, where x is literally anything, then I don't have free speech. It's that simple. This part is mostly a semantic argument that I'm making to point out how the West is full of dirty hypocrites who claim to value freedom. Moving on, the ban on inciting violence fails to recognize that all humans are independently acting agents. Or, at least, we tend to treat them as such with our current consensus on free will being a thing. To put it simply, most people understand that to force another human being to do something is impossible, except without a threat of force or blackmail. In reality, you still technically retain your freedom to choose regardless of threats or blackmail, but we all seem to sanction these off anyway. If I don't have a gun to your head, there's nothing I can do to force you to do anything. I can use psychological tactics if I want, or I can bargain with you, or I can plead and grovel, but in general we all at least pretend to understand that I have done nothing that removes your independence, your role as a discretely acting agent. So, for example's sake, let's say we have Hitler 2.0 on the scene, rising in social influence with a bloodlust for the Jews. What can he do to force you to go out and kill a Jew? Well, he can blackmail you or threaten your life or the lives of your loved ones. If those happened, I think we can all agree Hitler 2.0 bears most of the responsibility if you go out and murder someone. But what if Hitler 2.0 simple told you to ? No guns, no threats, no blackmail, nothing. He just meets you on the street and says, Hey man, I think it would be pretty great for you to go kill a dude today. Then you go do it. Whose fault is it? I'd argue that Hitler 2.0 really isn't at fault in this scenario because there wasn't any coercion involved. He just said to do it, and you freely chose to of your own volition. The extreme nature of this example may make it hard to see, but in this instance, the fault lies with you. All of it, arguably. You exercised your freedom of choice and independent action and killed someone. It doesn't matter who put the idea in your head, and it doesn't matter who convinced you it was a good idea. All that matters is that you weighed the options and made the choice. The key, again, is that we treat all people as freely acting agents. Free will is a thing that we recognize to exist. If you still disagree, consider the alternative. Let's say I encourage you to hurt someone, and you do it. In this scenario, however, we are assuming that humans are not freely acting agents. We are assuming that the power of influence that others have over you trumps your own conscience, your own free will, and your own capacity to act as you wish. Already you should be seeing that this is a huge, and quite irrational, assumption. We are assuming that because you hurt someone, the fault lies not with you, who did the hurting, but with me, who encouraged you to do it. In simpler terms, we are declaring that my incitation of violence is directly and immediately responsible for the victim's death, which you might think sounds reasonable. But remember those assumptions, the ones that say free will doesn't exist, or at least mitigate its importance? Those are still on the table, so we're forced to ask ourselves Why did I incite the violence in the first place? If your answer is because you're a terrible person who wants to hurt others, you are contradicting yourself. You said earlier that your act of murdering an individual was my fault because you were influenced into doing it. But if that's the case, then who is influencing me into inciting violence? We can't assume that you have no free will and then go right back and assume that I do. If the murder can't be your fault because someone else made you want to do it, then making you want to do it can't be my fault, because someone made me want to do that. At this point, you may be exasperated, saying, Bringing free will into this is thinking too big. But I'm afraid you'd be wrong. In this murder example, we are discussing culpability. If inciting violence should indeed not be freely protected, we are making the judgment about where the culpability of a crime falls. If it's my fault that you hurt someone because I told you to do it, we are tacitly saying that you have no free will, that you have no capacity to act as an independent agent. Let's return to the example of you murdering someone. Who should rightly go to prison? If you should, we acknowledge the presence of free will in you, and thus it's only rational that I stay free. It doesn't make sense to double up on culpability here. If we try to say that you're guilty for killing him, and I'm guilty for telling you to, it's very obvious that we aren't done. If we're being consistent, we also have to arrest the person who made me want to make you commit the murder. But then we'd have to arrest the person who made that person make me want to make you want to commit the murder. If this progression seems absurd to you, it shouldn't. We're only following your own argument to its logical conclusion. In the end, the core issue at hand is whether, and under what circumstances, I can be blamed for something I have not personally done. The key is that this is a switch, not a dial. Either you alone are responsible for the murder, or I am for influencing you, and my dad for influencing me, and his coworker influencing him, and that coworker's aunt for influencing her, ad infinitum. TL DR I agree that inciting violence is wrong. For speech to be free, there are to be no exceptions. Otherwise, by definition, it is not free. Humans have free will. Unless you are coerced into doing something, you alone are responsible for doing it. If we do not recognize this, the path of influence we must trace to determine culpability never ends. Inciting violence, i.e. instructing or encouraging people to commit violence, is not coercion.

Whereas not a fan of Foucault, I can certainly understand his concern. Since that time, the birth of science, today the mentality around science has changed a lot. It developed, and what we fail to notice is how similar that was to adherence and development of a religion. It's about changing people's perception of the origin of the universe. Even though the adherents to a non critical support of science didn't admit, they believed things pretty much where that way because a scientist said it. Obviously, the striking difference was there much more often than not, they were right. Well, that's valuable. It convinced a lot of people. However, science started to develop into something of its own. The method started to be applied to things far away from it. And so we have social darwinism or nazi experiments or psychiatrical over pathologization, obstetric violence, etc. I can go more in depth about each, but the overall justification and ultimate word on these matters were that it's science therefore it's right . this helps us start thinking therefore on the implications of this trust we give to scientists. it means power. science cannot be treated as separate from the influences of our economical, political, anthropological reality. it is before anything a creation of humans highly dependent on language. it is not acceptable logically to trust an institution with ultimate word . the behavior displayed in our current 2014 context is one in which a link to a so called source with a paper is a proof of something. people will silence themselves and accept it. that is not, in my way of seeing things, a method for critical thinking. it is not what a skeptic would do, in the philosophical sense. this word has lost meaning to atheism. skeptic is not someone who doubts the supernatural, the religious, or anything specific. a skeptic, in philosophy, doubts pretty much everything. Some were as far as to doubt empirical, personal, sensory interactions see solipsism In seeing the current relationship most people have with religion nowadays, skeptics would be very intrigued by how science alienates us, and how some things are just messed up. In this sense, I am a skeptic. But it doesn't mean that anymore. We have developed a social relation towards science that resembles religion itself.

Richard Dawkins is one such man. Eventually, one must realize not all problems in the world are caused by X, whatever X is. Our problems are caused by many issues, and they must be addressed, all of them. Vehement support for people such as Dawkins, Sam Harris, Bill Maher, Christopher Hitchens, etc created a community of religious people known as neo atheists . This phenomena can be extended to all sectors of life. For example, a teacher will convey knowledge which is scientific , present in the school books. The school books are shipped by the government. In varying levels, the government has decent autonomy in deciding the content of such books. At this point, science and scientific process already mean very little. Science here works as simply a tool of precision, the exact content can be manipulated easily. Consider this You are sick. You go to the doctor. The doctor, a student of science, diagnoses you with disease X. The doctor proceeds to write a prescription. The doctor, who has very tight ties with a pharmaceutical company, and gives you a prescription for a drug by that same company. Was that scientific? It is claimed to be. Consider another Scientists as paid professionals do create things to be sold. The goal of the scientist is to therefore create things that are profitable. That means they might not want to invent things that do not yield profit. Many things that we need and are possible end up not made because that would hurt profits. For example, things that definitely cure people, vaccines for high profiting diseases, etc. Consider another who finances research? Often, companies interested in certain things, for certain purposes. How does this affect research? I can see the uses of science, and very good ones, in many cases, especially referring to investigating biology, physics, mathematics. It's great to build machines, explore places we can't visit space, deep ocean, inside the earth , and many other things. However, it should be taken with skepticism, as anything should. I believe natural science makes overreaching claims in fields where it does not belong. For example, psychiatry will often depict depression as something related simply to a chemical imbalance in our brains. This is very limited and psychology itself will promptly be more reasonable in saying somethings are from our lives, our experience as conscious beings, society, that can make us depressed too . In this sense, medication is simply not a single treatment for many cases. Or when someone is diagnosed something for trying to be the center of attention . Frankly, that's just a trait of humans. Pathologization alienates people who go into paranoia thinking they are mentally ill. It's necessary to think thoroughly what you actually mean when you pronounce the word science . What is this entity you speak of? Is it the method? Is it the scientists? Is it the papers? What is it? Is this body among the intricate web of social, economical, political, anthropological interactions? Yes? Then perhaps is it not utilized by it in some ways? I'd now like to antecipate some questions I understand science is useful for quite a lot of things. I don't believe science should be abolished, but I do believe science should be taken more skeptically by the general public and should try itself to develop an overall sense in people that it's OK to question, disagree and seek other opinions on matters. for example, if a doctor tells you something, it's OK to ask another doctor. If someone tells you that black people or women are inferior because of science evolution , you can and should challenge it. If someone tells you transgender people shouldn't have civil rights am I hitting home already? because of science, you should challenge that, and so on. Some people will mimic religious behavior almost identically, and their faith in science will go as far as translating into harassment of transgender people, to take one example. because they firmly believe that, because science dictates something, that this person is wrong in its premises . thus is the characteristic of dogma. This creates a certain scientific orthodoxy , tow things that should sound as a contradiction together, but really aren't. some people will eventually start developing science that claims different things, and uses scientific data do prove the orthodox, hard line, reductionist ones that when social scientists said gender they were not referring to genitals, brains, or anything in the spectrum of natural sciences, but rather about social relations created by people with how to behave and relate to each other and the world , or something along those lines."}, {"conclusion": "The more is produced, the more needs to be consumed.", "id": 43498, "argument": "Without advertising, people wouldn't be buying things they do not necessarily need, which would slow the economy down, as economy cannot grow unless people consume."}, {"conclusion": "I don't see many positive things about this decade.", "id": 48048, "argument": "I'm having trouble finding anything positive about this decade.

We should be free to live it however we want, so long as our activities don't negatively impact another person's rights. Some people even go as far as valuing a person's value based on how much they contribute to society. Does it really matter in the end? When we talk about productivity, we normally think about the end results. Video games, movies, etc are more about the journey. If one is paying his her bills and doing his her job properly, where is the problem?

The fact of the matter is throughout human history peaceful protest action has achieved very little, indeed I would strongly argue any success that can be attributed too it instead stems from a fear of mass violence which would follow should the protestors views not be addressed. Consider some examples and contrasts Poll Tax Riots Hundreds of thousands of people rioting forces a British Government U Turn in the poll tax, violence clearly brings results. 2010 Student Protests Tens of thousands of students engage in peaceful protest, they achieve nothing. Occupy Wall Street A bigger failure than the Titanic's maiden voyage Protests in Ukraine and Syria Both showed no capacity to achieve any results until they embraced violence, I wouldn't call the resulting mess of either a success but its clear violence was necessary to effect any level of change. Civil Rights India Apartheid I'd argue in each of these cases while a veil of peaceful protest was sold to the world it was in reality fears of mass civil disobedience, riots and to a degree civil war which caused meaningful reform and change in these circumstances. The blacks could have picketed in South Africa for 50 years and they'd have accomplished nothing, a terrorist campaign was a necessity to force change. The situation in the same in India and while slightly more blurry in the US its still clearly a key motivator. Sitting here right now I can't think of a single important thing peaceful protest has helped with or tackled, if you want something addressed you need to fight for it you can't just expect it to be handed too you. Yes picketing might make them build a new London Airport rather then a 3rd Runway at Heathrow but this represents a wholly separate standard of issue to which I am referring. If the several hundred thousand people who attended Occupy Wall Street stuff went their with the willingness to die and fight for their cause I assure you the movement would have effects that would have resonated till today, rather its weak and wholly nonviable method of pushing its goals made it pointless. My perhaps biggest point is though the acceptance of peaceful protest as a viable form of enacting change, when it isn't, causes people to pursue it rather then avenues which would deliver results. As a result all it does is force the continuation of social stagnation, arguably it's just part of a wider collection of measures which our plutocratic states employ to provide the illusion of our opinions actually mattering. So yeah out to you lot, change my view prove that peaceful protest does serve some good and helps bring about meaningful change. Also would classify peaceful protests which gain their strength from the fact they could turn into mass riots at any second as not peaceful."}, {"conclusion": "The fact that boardgames are a social event that connects you with people in real space is a benefit.", "id": 35843, "argument": "You learn more about a person when you interact with them in real life.

I do however think the royal family are a tremendous waste of money at the moment Anyhow I think other countries do this just fine with an elected head of state, why can't the UK have one. I'd argue you have a head of state elected when you hold parliamentary elections. You could use some kind of single transferable vote I guess, and I would imagine the main political parties could put up candidates. Looking at what the royal family have done gt In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II, acting on the advice of the government, refused to signify her consent to the Military Action Against Iraq Parliamentary Approval Bill, which sought to transfer from the monarch to Parliament the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq. gt In 1974, the serving Prime Minister Edward Heath attempted to remain in power but was unable to form a working majority. The Queen then asked Harold Wilson, leader of the Labour Party, which had the largest number of seats in the Commons but not an overall majority, to attempt to form a government. Subsequently Wilson asked that if the government were defeated on the floor of the House of Commons, the Queen would grant a dissolution, which she agreed to. 21 I don't think they are particularly active heads of state. I kind of like the idea of keeping it that way still. I'd also like to give people the option to recall the head of state though, just so you didn't end up with someone who well and truly screwed things up. I think that maybe if 60 of the electorate were to sign a thing calling for the recall of the head of state that the position should be put up for the vote again, but with the current head of state unable to run. I also think that if turn out for the position of head of state is under 40 then the role should just be given to someone selected at random, just like jury duty.

But they should then just enlist them to South Korean schools, not those of a terrorist regime that regularly threatens to destroy Japan apparently not caring about killing their expatriates along with it . I can understand the desire of these Koreans to be proud of their nationality, especially since Japanese society tends to consider them as foreigners despite living there for generations but they should then just decide to become South Koreans. After all, they never lived in North Korea since the country was still unified when they went to live in Japan, they just arbitrarily decided to join the North Korean association rather than the South Korean one.

With other forms like writing a biography, essay, interview, scholarly journal, report all of which can educate someone. A fiction novel of many varieties, comic strip, graphic novel, compilation of jokes, a satire, a parody, folklore, a theatrical play, a diary or a script can all entertain someone. Messages can be transferred from one to another in articles, lists, reviews, letters, brochures, and advertisements to list a few. Although poetry can obviously be grouped in the entertainment category it seems to be the most useless in that category and if placed in that category, I assume if would find the most trouble in achieving its goal of entertaining an audience despite being such a popular genre of writing. As a Baltimore native, I can appreciate the poetry of Edgar Allen Poe, in addition to poets from all over the world. However, despite this, many people, including me, seem to vocalize more that poetry, more frequently than other genres, is the writing form where they gain significantly less from analyzing it than other forms. I know I may sound ignorant but as someone who has examined a wide variety of poetry through different mediums ranging from simply reading haikus, sonnets, epics, and free verse poems, amongst many others, and at the other end of the spectrum, attending poetry slams and interviewing poets I can still conclude that poetry remains the most useless, unenjoyable, and seemingly purposeless form of writing. You might say that the purpose of poetry is to provide an outlet for the poet to express themselves or a way for them to more easily send a message although I would refute that and argue that the other genres mentioned, more specifically the major genres rather than the less prevalent genres mentioned used as fillers to emphasize my point, would more effectively achieve these goals and more. Overall, I believe poetry is the most useless form of writing and the world hasn't benefitted much from it and would be virtually the same if poetry never existed.

But I think if we can understand where it comes from and what causes it maybe we can figure out how to combat it. before launching into my idea of a dotted line connection between the uncanny valley and racial bias, i'd like to present a recent study of the psychology of the alt right. Not to pick on them necessarily, it's just an example we have close at hand Perusing this data we can see some alarming, but not surprising, trends from a vox article that surmises some of the data On average, they rated Muslims at a 55.4 again, out of 100 , Democrats at 60.4, black people at 64.7, Mexicans at 67.7, journalists at 58.6, Jews at 73, and feminists at 57.

So what's going on here? The people scoring them lower see them as less human than themselves . Which leads me to the uncanny valley. I'll cut and paste a quick description for those who aren't aware of what the uncanny valley is gt In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is the hypothesis that human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion or uncanniness among some observers. 2 Valley denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness. 3 We only really discuss this in terms of robot replicas but that's only because we've killed off, directly or indirectly, every other near human thing in existence long before recorded history. My view is that what some of us feel as racial hatred is just an offshoot, a cousin if you will, of this effect.

Eventually, the baby boomer population will be declining at a rapid rate which will open up a massive number of houses to the market.

It was comparing it to homeless Americans, numbering 3.5 million which is an entirely different problem. houses in 2015 Fertility rates are also declining significantly in the United States. The largest decline was actually in the 15 to 19 down by about two thirds since 1995 demographic, followed by the 20 to 24 demographic, all millennials. I actually believe the 15 to 19 decline is a good thing, because the cost of living is out pacing increases in wages. I've read that this is the most recent prime driver in the decline, but there is statistically significant data linking better health care to declining birth rates in every country. not enough to say it's direct causation decline in birth rates The impact of a decline in birth rate is expressed here in this article. population growth with and without immigration in the USA In the Total US Population In Thousands chart, it's showing 340,887,000 million US population in 2050, which is only an increase of about 13 million people from today. So, you have an estimated 18.6 million empty homes today, with 3.5 million homeless people and a projected population growth to 2050 without immigrants of only 13 million people. That's still a surplus of about 2 million homes without building any new homes, assuming every single one of those people lives alone. That definitely won't be the case, because of the large numbers of dependents both minors and seniors who won't be able to live alone at that time. Yes, I know combining these numbers is a bit wonky because it doesn't take into consideration the change in homeless population. I'm having trouble finding projections for that, sorry. Without immigration, the ongoing situation in Detroit where they are demolishing homes, is likely to be the situation in other locations in the United States by 2050. It would also lead to a significant decline in the value of houses in the USA, which would in turn negatively impact US GDP. Change my view gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

I know very few things about reddit but I know I have to be nice to everyone and open to criticism and other views. And I am. And English is not my first language, not even my second and I know it is very bad. So, if somebody can help me improve my language and remove ambiguities, I will be very thankful. Q What the hell is Legal Parental Surrender? gt A Legal Parental Surrender LPS allows a parent to surrender his her all rights and obligations on their child , but in the early stages of pregnancy and not after that. This post will specifically deal with LPS rights for men. Justice therefore dictates that if a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring pregnancy to term, and the biological father does not, and cannot, share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support. Or, put another way, autonomous women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their choice. Karen Decrow, former president of NOW I have seen so many post regarding LPS and I have made a plan on how to legalizing it without exploiting women and I have seen the opinions against it. So, I made a scheme to help minimize the loopholes. Recently I came up on this issue and even though I consider myself a feminists or egalitarian , I think men are helpless in some cases. Please read my plan keeping in mind that, men are humans and not wild dogs. First things first. These are the criteria that must be there, so that LPS can be made legal, these are compulsory Abortion is easily accessible to women and fairly cheap. Both man and woman have consensual relationship. they are unmarried. both are healthy enough and mentally sound. abortion is not a taboo in that place . safe heaven laws are present Scenario Both man and the woman are young, they already talked that if she somehow got pregnant, she will get abortion. They have healthy consensual sex, both used protection, but somehow, for some reason, she got pregnant. The man then asks her to get abortion but she changed her mind and she think she might continue the pregnancy and raise the child. Now, my plan for the sake of arguments, let us assume the legal time period for a woman to get abortion is 20 weeks. say So, the woman finds out she is pregnant and informs the man. At that moment , the man signs a legal document, a document declaring that he has the knowledge that the woman is pregnant. Lets call it Acknowledgement paper . Both of their signatures will be there, both will have two copies of the document and the document can be easily downloaded from a website. The document also contains the date and time of the signature. So from that moment, the man has exactly 10 weeks half of legal time period for abortion to decide whether he want to surrender all rights and obligation for the POTENTIAL child or if he wants to be a part of its life. Say, at the last day of the 10th week, he informs the woman that he wants to opt out. And he signs a legal document titled LPS with his signature, the time and the date which can also be downloaded from a website and gives her a carbon copy. The document will also contain the female's signature. LPS document has only two options, either he can surrender all obligations and responsibilities or he can be a father , and take proper care of his child with the mother. So, from that moment on, the female will have another 10 weeks to decide whether she wants to give birth to the child and raise him her or if she want to get an abortion. If she thinks she is financially stable enough, or some other family member is willing to help etc etc, she can give birth to the child. If she thinks she is not ready yet, she can have abortion. No one can legally force her to take any decision. And, whatever her choice is, the man will have to cover the costs. If she decides to get an abortion, the man will have to pay for it, if she decides to continue the pregnancy , the man will have to pay some amount to her, he will be agreeing to this when he signs the LPS document, irrespective of his choice to opt in or opt out. EVERYTHING CLEAR UP UNTIL NOW? SO FAR, SO GOOD? NOW Q A TIME Q1 Hey Mister, if you want to achieve equality, why the man gets 10 weeks to decide and the woman gets 20? Not fair gt A This is made so that the man cannot trick the woman into carrying the child anyway. Lets say, the man also gets 20 weeks, same as the woman. Then at the 19th week and 6th day, he tells her that Sorry I don't want any responsibilities, you have to raise him her on your own, here is the document , then the women is totally screwed , she has to raise the baby, no other way This cannot happen. So, I have given the man enough time, such that , after that the female will also have enough time to take decision. Q2 But if the man bails out, the taxpayers will have to pay for it. Is that fair? gt A As per my plan, the taxpayers shouldn't pay for it. The woman will have enough time to decide if she can raise the child in good environments or not, if she is financially stable enough. And as a bonus, we can make advisers in all cities who will help woman decide that very thing. If the state or some welfare organisation want to occasionally help out , with money or in some other way, then that is very good, but that would be occasional and optional. Q3 This is not right. This will encourage men to go have sex with women and impregnating them and creating babies. gt A Not really. LPS gives men a choice, A choice at the very early stage of pregnancy. It doesn't encourage them. What is wrong here is that we are automatically assuming men are some condescending and irresponsible pricks, who care for no one. That is not true, some are some are not. Men are also humans. Some will opt out , some will opt it. But the good thing is, if the father opts in , he will be doing so, willingly and the child will be loved and taken care by both the parents. Q4 But this allows men to exploit women gt A As per my plan, there is literally no way a man can trick a women. He cannot bail out after 10 weeks. The woman can take this to the court. Q5 But what if the woman hides her pregnancy from the man, till the 10th week. gt A So the man can sue her in the court. He can tell the court he didn't sign any paper of acknowledgement. The burden of producing Acknowledgement paper is on the woman, the burden of producing the LPS paper is on the man. And remember, both the documents will have the signatures of them both along with date and time. Q6 This is not the same as abortion. gt A I am not saying it it, I am pro choice and I believe the man should have at least a single choice other than saying IF HE DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE PREGNANT , HE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD SEX . This is why I didn't use the term Paper abortion or Financial abortion . Q7 But abortion is about bodily autonomy and if he surrenders his obligation, there is an actual child. A child's right is more important than the fathers. gt A This is the misconception here. The man cannot surrender when the baby is born. Lets say he didn't sign any LPS document, then the baby is born and he say Eww, that baby is so ugly, I don't want to be responsible for that . Well that is not even possible. He is bound to support the child. If he still denies, then the woman can take the matter to the court, the court will ask the man to show the LPS document and BAM He cannot, so he is done No other choice than to take care of the child. gt We have to remember, when the man is allowed to make a decision, there is no child, for sake of simplicity , we can say it is a 50 50 chance that the child will be born or not. If the woman consciously knows that she can have abortion without health risks , knows the father won't give any support, then still decides to bring the child into this world, then wouldn't it be fair to assume that she is financially stable enough and she took a conscious decision that she can raise the child alone? A child is entitled to proper care and support , but that doesn't mean support from both parents. You have to remember many woman decide to have babies from donor sperms. I think single mothers who consciously chose to be single mothers are strong and independent enough to give proper care to their child. IMO, thinking otherwise, is a bit sexist. Q8 Abortion and pregnancy are not a piece of cake. gt A I know , actually I don't know that much, I am not a woman . But whatever decision the man makes, he will pay for the abortion and at least help her financially with pregnancy. This is the least he should do. Q9 Biology is unfair kid, man and woman are not equal in this scenario. gt A I know , Biology is unfair and unequal but the law shouldn't. LPS doesn't make the man's right equal to women's. But at least , it gives him some choice other than HE SHOULD PUT HIS DICK IN HIS PANTS, IF HE DIDN'T WANT THE BABY . Q10 But this will indirectly force the woman to get an abortion, as being a single parent is hard and the man doesn't help etc etc. gt A See, this is where I don't agree with you. As a feminist, I think men and woman are equally strong and capable. I don't think a woman should have a child, just because she thinks they are cute and she like the idea of being a mother, but she is neither financially stable not ready yet, but still she has the child because the father is financially capable. This is year 2017 not 1850s. gt If she thinks she can't support the child by herself and is fully aware that no one else is going to help her raise the child, she should not continue the pregnancy. She will have enough time and some help from state appointed advisers to help her make a decision, if she wants to. Q11 But this will encourage men to have unprotected sex and they will not wear condoms. gt A Uh Maybe. But if LPS becomes legal, women will be extra cautious. And remember, in my hypothetical place abortion is safe, cheap and easily accessible in any parts. Plus , remember that condom also protects from STDs ,not just making a woman pregnant. So , I still think men should and would wear condoms. Q12 Your plan is too complicated dude, current system is much better. gt A But but men are human too, you know. We have to stop assuming that all men are condescending and irresponsible pricks, who just want to have sex. Some men are bad , some are good just like some women are bad and some are very good. This will give them a choice. You cannot uplift women by kicking down men. Q13 Men have a choice, if they don't want the consequences of having sex, then they shouldn't put their dicks into the vagina or have a vasectomy. gt A OH MY GOD How can you say this? How would you feel if I said If a woman didn't want to get pregnant, she should have has sex or If a women didn't want to get pregnant she shouldn't let a man ejaculate inside her or If a woman didn't want to get pregnant, she should have done hysterectomy . How does that sound? I know,disgusting. right? This exact argument is used by pro life people against abortion but then you will say abortion is about body autonomy, not pregnancy. BUT IT IS, indirectly abortion is a way to end pregnancy. Please, just please, don't use this argument in the comments. Q14 Do you really think that this LPS can be a real thing? gt A To be honest, I know that it is highly unlikely that LPS will ever become a thing in majority of countries , I am fully aware of that. I also know that this will face more opposition than support. And to be honest, will will need the help of feminists on this. True feminists that is. Q15 What if the father wants to enter into the child's life later? gt A Well, lets say the child is 10 years old, and the biological father suddenly appears and says I made a huge mistake, I was naive, can I take care of my child now ? Well, legally, he gave up all his rights when he opt out by signing LPS. But the best he can do is request and ask the mothers or whoever is the legal guardian of the child at that time. If say says No f you, you left me and my child when we needed you the most. Go away , then he has no other option to walk away, but if he persists, then the woman can send him to jail. gt But if she agrees , then I guess she can take the matter to the court, arrive on an agreement and raise the child together from that moment on. Q16 What if the child is 18 years old, and he she wants to meet his father? gt A Well, the child is an adult now, so, the law cannot and shouldn't not stop him her. It is his her decision after all. Q17 But the child deserves the love and care of both parents. Doesn't he she? gt A In an ideal world, yes. But the current system doesn't do anything better. The child will still have one parent and will receive a monthly paycheck. The paycheck is not equal to a loving and caring father. If LPS becomes legal, either the child will have a single loving and caring parent or two loving and caring parents. The child won't have a loving parent and another parent who hates him her and considers a burden and sends a monthly paycheck and stays away from them. Q18 Why is money more important to you people then the child? gt A That is a weird thing to say. Money doesn't grow on trees automatically. Everybody works hard to earn it. In today's world, money can help us get many things if not everything. And please don't forget, when the father is giving up his rights and obligations, there is no child at that time, not even a fetus and there is no 100 guarantee that a child will be born. He cannot give up the rights when a child is born and he shouldn't. Q19 What if the woman is medically unable to have abortion? gt A Then she can produce the medical certificate which declares that she will have serious health risks if she undergoes abortion and that certificate can void the LPS document signed by the man to opt out . I know this is not perfect. But I am trying to make LPS in such a way that the man cannot trick the woman and neither can she trick him in any way. If this actually harms women's' rights and choices in any way, please let me know. What do you think about it?

I'm going to explain why I think that is not true and why I also think it isn't even subjective to say that having a second referendum is more democratic than not. The starting point for my argument is that a more informed electorate will make decisions that better reflect their views, therefore the better informed an electorate the more democratic the vote. In the 2016 referendum it was clear that voting to remain in the EU meant keeping the same deal that was currently in place with Cameron's minor negotiated changes . However, leaving the EU could have meant, and could still mean, a wide range of outcomes. Would we remain in the customs union and single market? Would free movement of labour remain in place? ?Would we still pay fees towards the EU? These are all still unanswered questions. I think many people will have voted on the issues that mattered to them immigration, powers over regulations and free trade being key issues for different sides. This is analogous to people being asked to vote on whether or not we should have a cut in the marginal tax rate as pointed out by others before me. However, if the electorate voted for a 25 cut in their taxes, but were later startled by the fact that there was a 25 cut in funding for the NHS, schools and infrastructure that they were unaware would occur and no longer found this tax cut worthwhile, you cannot argue that this more democratic than if they had voted fully aware of these and had rejected the tax cut. Likewise, if it turns out the unexpected consequences of the exit deal struck between the EU and the UK is unpopular among voters, then it is undoubtedly unfair to impose this upon the population and claim it is the will of the people. Therefore, it is undoubtedly more democratic to have a second referendum than to not, once people are aware of what the terms of leaving the EU are. This should be encouraged equally by both leavers and remainers. Sorry, this is quite UK centric. But change my view Edit If you think I'm being stubborn please tell me, I am trying to keep an open mind, just yet to be convinced by any points raised EDIT 2 There's been similar arguments coming up so I'm going to do a quick response. Is what I see as Reductio ad absurdum It would be more democratic to have a 3rd, 4th, 5th when does it end? This is beside the point that the second is more democratic, crucially because the choice that was preferred in the first was such an uncertain choice, whereas the second would be between two certain choices. A 3rd ref. is a very different debate and would be under different circumstances as it would be a vote to rejoin, and is less justifiable in the near future. Also it definitely is uncertain since we still don't know what the terms will be for trade, free movement of capital, human rights, immigration etc. Edit 3 Message me if you have had your opinion changed, this thread will die soon and I'm still as of yet to have seen a valid point that holds enough weight to it.

Having such low expectations and standards for how people of color conduct themselves is itself is a form of racism that has real negative repercussions for nearly everyone affected by their attitudes, not least of all themselves.

The common arguments for LeBron being a better player involve stats related to longevity and being a better basketball player in a vacuum. People make excuses for his losses in finals due to not having a great team around him or things of the sort. However, and LeBron is a particularly good example of this, LeBron James has a lot of control over the team that is put around him. Further, LeBron James has the ability to walk to nearly every team in the NBA if he desires. Therefore, LeBron has chosen the situation around him, and thus if that situation is what prevents him from winning, it reflects on a choice that he made. Now let's talk about Tom Brady and Aaron Rogers. I understand, when you're drafted by a team, you're stuck with them for 4 or 5 years, more if they franchise tag you. Still, and my view can be changed on this, but the way I see it, the second Aaron Rogers signs his first extension with the Green Bay Packers you can no longer blame the talent around him, his front office, the defenses they give him, etc. for why he has less rings than Brady, because Rogers has chosen to remain in that situation. I'll close with a hypothetical. Currently Brady, 7 conference titles, 5 rings. Rogers 1 conference title, 1 ring. It's not close.

However it has also been noted by people from other countries western countries in particular that this growth was achieved partly due to the fact that we have placed our placed our economic prosperity and peace before our human rights. One prominent example of this would be our freedom of press which was ranked at 150 out of 180 countries. My government response to this was that in order to maintain social and racial harmony control over the media was necessary in order to prevent racial riot and social tension from occurring which would in turn weaken our economy. Personally after seeing the Baltimore riots, i started to understand the rationale behind some of their actions as i would definitely do not want my country to descend into chaos due to riots. Furthermore, after starting to work i have come to the realization sometimes putting food on the table is more important than the rights we have. In addition, to my surprise my government Media Development Agency MDA also monitor its people through the use of software provided by the Hacking Team they have a company in singapore . However, it seems like most singaporeans do not care if their country is monitoring their activities as i quote the common reply i get is '' I do not have anything to hide.So what should i be scared of?'' This mindset is very common as we feel that our country will only use the software to catch the bad people like terrorist and the invasion of our privacy is just for the greater good of the society so as to maintain peace and economic prosperity. So i have come to the conclusion that in order to have peace and economic prosperity some sacrifices of our human rights is a necessary evil. Change my view reddit.

As much as I'd like to be, i'm not very knowledgeable of the intricacies of politics due to several reasons but I do try my best to find my definitive stances so I can voice and act out accordingly. So this viewpoint takes a few things into consideration firstly that the two party system that dominates US politics is not ideal. Having more parties that actually have a chance in the election is an improvement weather that be a singular party addition or a whole plethora. This is for several reasons but mostly because the individual will have a representative to vote for that more accurately shares their values and political stances. The best way as an individual to push for this is to vote for the leading running up behind the major two parties. I can't even remember where I heard this but I have heard that if this party achieves about 5 of votes during the election, they receive a huge increase in budget for the next election. Even if this isn't necessarily true, giving this party a vote means i'm supporting a party outside of the major two. The third party doesn't even have to be the most personally optimal candidate because the idea is to get the party most likely to compete against the major two a chance. A sort of sub stance I have held in the past goes something like I should not change my vote to one of the two major candidates simply because I know any other party will lose. I feel there is likely a large group of voters who do do this and only feeds into the loop because they reinforce the fact that nobody else will win an election. Thanks ahead of time for having a discussion with me I'm new to the sub but I think I've figured out the delta system. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Since I haven't been talking about politics, I haven't had the need to figure out what to tell people my political views are in the first place. I live in the US, and the most common category people use to talk about politics is the left right split. I don't really know where I fall on that axis myself because I really haven't thought about it very much, but I figure regardless of what I say about it I'll have to figure out individual issues for myself, or else I'll inevitably end up having all kinds of stupid views just by association. I don't want to just call myself an independent or something like that though, because that's no fun. In any case, many people who call themselves liberals have positions that others would call conservative, and vice versa, so it's not as simple as just joining a political group and accepting their positions on everything. So I thought, why not just look at it in terms of group affiliation? This is something like identity politics, but I mean it more in terms of cultural values than political policies that favor particular groups. In terms of identity politics, I'm white, male, and straight, and I'm also relatively wealthy. I'm a first generation immigrant and grew up poor though. I have a few friends but not many, and I have no connections of any sort that would give me any kind of social advantage. Close to typical for the reddit crowd I imagine. Overall, I can't help but feel that just based on that and only that, I should just tell people I'm a conservative. It's hard not to see an obvious reality that people on the left just don't like people like me . They'll never say that to me outright of course, that's not how the discussion is supposed to be framed rather it's a matter of acknowleding your advantages in life, the fact that others have different and much more difficult circumstances, etc. Those are valid and valuable points, but in terms of the cultural zeitgeist on the left I think it's fair to say that being in my identity group is going to carry a very real kind of stigma for the foreseeable future. More importantly though, I think everyone has to be careful about allowing people to dicate values for them that require subordinating their own interests to the greater good at the very least, you'd better be sure you know who's in charge of determining what the greater good is, and what is going to be expected of you. What's my place in the ideally just society of progressive ideals? Will I be expected to prove that I'm not the wrong kind of person, particularly not the wrong kind of straight white male, who hasn't internalized right thinking well enough, for the foreseeable future? Obviously this is veering into kind of a caricature, but I challenge anyone to deny that this element of thinking is very real on the left. Even if a particular person is entirely friendly and non judgmental about people with opposing politics, they'll always have that friend or two who is just utterly intolerable unless you're not in the line of fire of their hostility, like that racist uncle who makes Thanksgiving awkward for everyone except people who are used to him and enable him. To put it bluntly, I don't see why I should put up with this. I try pretty hard to remain open minded and non judgmental, but at the end of the day I just flat out don't like people who don't like people like me . I think this is pretty understandable. Am I wrong to look at it this way? I can definitely see problems with this way of looking at it the right wing of US politics really is pretty anti intellectual see Trump , and the left is certainly right about one thing, that outright chauvinism isn't ethical or a winning political strategy in the long term. I think it sucks that what is nominally my crowd according to the categories set up by progressives has many subgroups that have values like this. Nonetheless, being who I am, I don't perceive them as actively hostile and openly dangerous to my well being both physical and emotional the way I perceive many on the left. Again, not in the line of fire. So, naturally, the answer is that I need to think of the well being of others before my own, particularly those who have it harder than me for various reasons. I agree, and I think I can do that and still call myself a conservative, which would allow me to just live my life and not worry about adapting to whatever new demands come from the authorities on the left. What to do in this situation? I think I should just say I'm a conservative and enjoy seeing people get riled up about it.  reddit gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Firstly by spreading goodwill I mean a huge, official initiative to help out other countries, a larger scale of aid to improve the quality of life. This isn't the kind of aid that has the condition, we'll give this if we can put a military base here the U.S. would ask nothing in return.

Now some nations have a real deep hatred for us, and with all the meddling we have done in the past it's hard to blame them. So mayve doing this won't do a damn thing for them many of the rural populations of the world will have no idea it's the U.S. sending them all this aid. Even though, I think many of the leaders of opposing nations wouldn't want to harm someone who is not only helping them out but also has helped out everyone else who would likely come to the U.S. aid or not ally with the enemy . We would not just cut out 400 billion on the budget overnight the military roots run deep in the U.S. and something like that cannot be undone fast. So my supposed goodwill campaign would be a many year plan where the budget is broken down little by little. Jobs that were supported by the millitary would be lost, but new jobs would result from this program too.

People without even doing research on it just pulled the rape argument and got the cover pulled. Another example happened in my personal life. On of my friends got accused of making a suggesting remark to a women in a joking manner. Instead of going to police or him directly she took to twitter talking about it and every other feminist agreed with her and took her word for the statement without even hearing the other side of the story.

Bill is the sympathetic character.", "id": 60067, "argument": "Real quick. Amsterdam's vendetta against Bill the Butcher, spurned by the death of his father at the Butcher's hands, lacks any moral justification. It is, in fact, on the side of the Butcher that reasonable grievance and thus moral high ground exist, since Amsterdam's uprising is best qualified not as an act of justice but as one of betrayal. Point 1 Priest Vallon's death was not murder, occurring as it did under the umbrella of \u201cthe ancient laws of combat.\u201d The movie gives no indication that The Battle for the Five Points in any way or at any time contravened these laws. When the horn is sounded, and the mass of humanity parts to find Bill standing over the mortally wounded priest, every member of the Irish coalition still standing recognizes that the victory being claimed is a just one, and no objection is raised. Point 2 The Priest's death at the hands of the Butcher is framed at every opportunity, most often by Bill himself, as a loss of life, not a loss of pride. The argument that Amsterdam must avenge his father's death in order to restore his family's name is not at all on. In fact, no one does more than Bill to bolster the honour associated with the Vallon name, keeping the Priest's memory alive by incorporating his great foe into what would become the battle's Myth, and doing so in a way that emphasized the leader of the opposition as a worthy rival and a man of honour. Conversely, it may be Amsterdam who jeopardizes the Vallon name by attempting a dishonorable sneak attack that is made possible only by deception, a point the Butcher is quick to announce as he stands over his former apprentice, now would be assassin. Point 2b That Amsterdam's grievance is based on either a faulty memory or an inability to see through his own pent up rage and appreciate the injustice in what he plans is best summed up by his warped view of the commemoration event. We see when Amsterdam first visits the Chinese establishment that he interprets the Chinaman's Dude. Asian American, please description as a vain act of boastfulness and mockery, when in fact the consuming of the flames is a tradition meant to invoke respect for and celebration of the dead. Point 3 Bill's maiming of Johnny Sirocco, while cruel, was well in proportion to Amsterdam's actions, both the assassination attempt and his resurrection and mobilization of the Dead Rabbits. On moral grounds, Amsterdam's attempted assassination qualifies as outright treachery when considering Bill's paternal treatment of the boy and his overwhelming role his quick ascent to Five Points elite. On quasi legal grounds, the Dead Rabbits uprising contravenes conditions of surrender agreed to under the Ancient Laws of Combat, rendering the casualties of that battle as having been in vain and once again leaving the Natives occupying the moral highground. Point 4 Quasi legal considerations aside, the uprising fails to meet any reasonable standard of justification on practical grounds. While the Battle of the Five Points is portrayed with little context, it is made clear that the confrontation was deemed necessary to bring an end to a long standing feud that had long rendered the Five Points as a neighbourhood in chaos. When Amsterdam returns as a grown man, he returns to a community that is impoverished, dangerous, and beehive of criminal activity, but that exists in a state of relative order and, in terms of ethnic feuds, coexistence, one in which people are capable of living their lives as they see fit. While bigotry exists, it is not the sole domain of any one group, and even those in power, the Natives, do not seem to allow their prejudices to hamper members of any \u201clesser\u201d groups, including the Irish, many members of which have actually transitioned to roles under the Butcher's authority and prospered. As a result, the climatic battle, triggered by the uprising, occurring within the context of larger disorder, leaves many men dead and the neighbourhood once again in tatters. And for what? What benefit? As part of a struggle against racism? Certainly not. For the betterment of the lives of the Irish and other non Natives? In what possible way? Is the Five Points going to suddenly transform into a law abiding utopia in Bill's absence? Please. The political sway held by Tammany Hall throughout New York City was responsible for any corruption that could be blamed for keeping the Points in its sorry state, and the film makes clear that Amsterdam is more than willing to take up the position beside Tammany that Bill had filled. In fact, whereas Bill recognized the dishonorable nature of the enterprise, there is no suggestion that even this level of reservation would enter Amsterdam's mind. Post script Why the hell Jenny Everdeane was so adamant on joining the uprising, who knows. She owes her life to Bill, who, as she explains to Amsterdam, took her in as a homeless child and as she entered adult hood, \u201cnever laid a hand on on me.\u201d Are we supposed to believe that her debt to Bill is nullified by the death of Johnny, a man whose existence she barely acknowledged while he was alive, or Amsterdam's maiming at the hands of Bill, which not only justified was probably a punishment less than what he deserved?"}, {"conclusion": "I believe that \"Hate Crime\" is an illogical term and that it creates resentment toward minorities and high risk groups.", "id": 136429, "argument": "Hate Crimes are idiotic. The very term is based in idiocy and puts forward the belief that there are normal crimes and then there are hate crimes . If I stab a man I have committed a crime. If I stab a man and say the word nigger or Spic or Homo then I have apparently committed a different crime wait I didn't its the same crime with a different social standing. I am against the creation of hate crime laws for a few reasons. 1 It doesn't target specific actions, it just states that if you commit the same crimes with hatred towards a race, religion, sexual orientation that you deserve a harsher punishment. Why should the guy who stabbed someone not get the same punishment at the guy who stabbed someone while screaming an obscenity? 2 They completely disregard the main purpose pf justice. Justice is about righting wrongs. The system is built on protecting society by finding people who commit crimes and bestowing fair punishment for those crimes. Hate crime law seeks to do the same thing except throw in a dash of morality. The rule of law isn't meant to instill morals, its meant to protect. To serve and protect . The second they start pushing morals on people is the second the state has entered into dangerous territory. Suddenly, whoever is in power in government has a chance to steer the moral direction of the entire country. 3 They don't change the fact hate crimes are committed. Now that we have a law in place, this will obviously stop hate crimes except it doesn't. We create laws to serve a purpose. Before these laws were put in place there was never a case where someone who murdered a gay, black, muslim, etc. person walked because there wasn't a hate crime law. They still murdered someone. They still faced the consequences of their actions. To say we need another layer of laws on the books is pointless. No one who targets a gay person is saying I'd really like to stab that faggot in the neck and go to prison for normal murder but those damn hate crime laws are stopping me ."}, {"conclusion": "One of the single most effective ways to reduce gun related homicide is to disarm front line police officers.", "id": 49692, "argument": "I believe that the main incentive for carrying a firearm when committing a crime is that you may need to defend yourself against armed police. Because criminals tend to be armed normal citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against those criminals. Disarming the police would reduce the need for criminals to carry firearms and so generally reduce the perceived need to carry a gun by citizens. By removing this normalcy of this type of weapon is reduced and a reduced rate of gun related homicide should be seen. This is borne out in countries like the UK and applies specifically to guns rather than all non lethal arms. When asked, UK police officers say overwhelmingly that they wish to remain unarmed. A 2006 survey of 47,328 Police Federation members found 82 did not want officers to be routinely armed on duty, despite almost half saying their lives had been in serious jeopardy during the previous three years."}, {"conclusion": "In the majority of circumstances it's not morally permissible to live beyond your means", "id": 87967, "argument": "I don't think it's ok for people to spend more than they earn in most circumstances. While I appreciate why pay day loan companies exist, their improper use has lead to many people getting in ridiculous amounts of debt for no good reason. In a lot of situations this could have been avoided if people had just been patient enough to wait until they had raised enough money to buy whatever it is they're wanting the money for. However, I appreciate that loans can be used well and do have a place so I have a few exceptions for this 1 Borrowing to 'invest' in a future endeavour with the aim of being able to reclaim the money either directly because of the endeavour or because it gives you an advantage which should lead to your making money. I'm thinking along the lines of borrowing for University tuition student living costs, buying a car that you can't get to work without, setting up your own business. 2 Buying an appropriate house given your income . It's going to cost you money paying rent, you might as well be using that same money to pay a mortgage instead. However, buying a much more expensive house than you can afford to pay a mortgage on is a bit different. 3 You are unemployed have no income have a very low income. If you don't have an income, or have such a low income that it doesn't cover necessities and I mean actual necessities you're going to have to pay out more than you're getting in just to survive. In a way this is similar to point one because you're 'investing' in your self. E.g. you can't earn more money if you're dead. 4 'Emergencies'. Sometimes stuff happens. Maybe a family member becomes ill medical bills need to be paid. Maybe your house got damaged and you need to pay the insurance excess to get it fixed. Sometimes things just happen that you can't plan for in advance, and it needs fixed right then. Fair enough, you can save up the money for it after the fact. My exceptions are quite common so I know my title of 'majority of circumstances' is a little dodgy but I didn't feel like 'many circumstances' quite cut it. While this seems like such a crazy thing to do there are so many people out there in debt for, seemingly, no good reason. I have personal experience of a family member who lives well beyond their means and I just don't understand why they do it beyond wanting to 'maintain their lifestyle'. Without a guarantee of a higher income somewhere down the line, it just seems absurd to me because you're going to have to make concessions at some point. Why wait till it becomes a problem? This is a view that I thought twice about putting on here because I feel like it just makes sense. But there are so many people out there who do this so I thought I'd see if they have a good reason for doing so. Or do they accept that it's a stupid thing to do just put it down to human imperfection? Who knows, perhaps I'll find out Please try to  Side note I hate people who cherry pick arguments so I will be replying to everything until arguments just get too repetitive or I have my view changed. This ended up being quite a project, although a very rewarding one, in the last  I did so if it's anything like that it'll take me a bit of time but I'll try to respond to everything Edit Right, my view hasn't yet been changed but thank you to everyone who has participated in this debate as I think I learned a few important things about why I have this view. I think this is just an important achievement as having had my view changed and discussing this has been a very valuable experience for me. I'll post below my reasoning. In the spirit of , you are free to continue trying to change my view However, having learned more about my moral values I don't think my view will change. I think it's immoral to live your life in a way that negatively impacts other people. This is an extremely high moral standard that it's impossible to live up to whilst still engaging with the modern world. I think my main mistake has been presuming that other people shared this same moral viewpoint as myself. I suppose this is partly forgivable because, although everyone is entitled to their opinion, I of course think my morals are the best morals. I wouldn't be very strong in my convictions if I didn't Most people think that they should live their lives not doing immoral things. Because other people have different moral standards this may be possible for them, but because my moral standards are so high I accept that it's impossible for me to do so if I want to live anything resembling a 'normal' life. So I continue to eat meat, drive around in cars do things that according to my moral code are immoral because I couldn't function in society without doing these similar things. That I need to do some of these things to function is my justification for them but doesn't make them any less immoral. However, although I believe doing some immoral things is inevitable I want to limit the number of immoral things that I do and see living in even more unnecessary luxury and in that taking unnecessary risks which could negatively affect other people than I already do as something I want to avoid. According to my moral code I'm already living an immoral life, I just need to try to limit the number of immoral things I do as much as I can and do as many positive things as I can.

First, what's important about holidays isn't what they celebrate, so much as when they are. I support Labor Day, for example, not because I particularly feel like celebrating labor , but because early September is a good time for a holiday. It is the semi official end of summer, and for many, the beginning of the school year. And nobody expects you to do anything but relax and enjoy your day off. Same thing for many other holidays, like Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, etc. Even Christmas was picked for the time of year, and most of the celebration is generic winter end of year stuff that has little to do with Jesus and existed before Jesus came along . Holidays provide a rhythm and structure for the year, and the memorable ones are the ones that serve this function. My issue with MLK day is simply the timing. It's cold and it's too close to New Years for people to really appreciate having time off. And it's detracted from President's Day, which is spaced out further from New Years. When I was in high school, we only got the latter day off, and it was always a much needed break. Then in college, it was the opposite we only got MLK Day off. MLK Day didn't feel like much of a holiday since it was at the start of the term, and by President's Day I would have really appreciated a 3 day weekend. If they could find some excuse to have MLK Day during the spring or fall, rather than the depths of winter, I'd support it. I imagine a counter argument to this is so what? You can have MLK day and other holidays. But clearly there's limits to this, you can only have so many of them. Im particular, the fact that people are celebrating President's Day less in order to celebrate MLK Day more shows that just having them all won't happen. Second reason, the focus shouldn't be on one person. If you want to have a holiday about the Civil Rights Movement, or about equality, that's one thing, but then call it Civil Rights Day or some such. Calling it MLK Day promotes the Great Man theory of history that history is all about a few great men who come along and change things. It makes it seem like everything sucked until MLK came along and changed it. That might not be the intended message, or what you redditors think, but it's the message I got as a kid. And it often seems to infect the popular narrative about civil rights. Most people's reasoning for MLK Day being a holiday is simply that MLK was a great person. Granted but so what? There's lots of great Americans, but only one with his own holiday, if you don't count President's Day, and also an Italian guy has one for some reason. I don't like holidays named after people. It seems like something they'd do in a monarchy extolling certain individuals as worthy of official praise, or something. It seems wrong to me, even if you think the person is worthy. It's almost like a title of nobility. Finally, this isn't an argument against the day, but it bothers me that MLK Day is supposed to be more than a regular holiday. Most holidays are understood as chances to enjoy time off, but the Federal Government calls MLK Day a day on, not a day off in promoting community service. They don't promote anything like this for other holidays. There's a lot of bland, shallow rhetoric on MLK Day about diversity, equality, etc. It's all very PC and devoid of content. I imagine even MLK Day supporters agree with this, that they've toned down what MLK really thought, to appeal to more people. I don't like holidays in which people are supposed to do more than just whatever the hell they feel like. Most holiday celebration feels organic, bottom up there was no executive order for people to have BBQs on memorial day, or eggnog on Christmas those are just activities that start among people and grow popular until it's a tradition. But MLK Day feels forced, top down. Nobody wants to do anything, so people try and make it something it's not. Holidays should be about relaxing with family and friends, not about having a greater message. They should be about seasonal traditional food and activities, not participating in some superficial activity in service of some bland ideals. ."}, {"conclusion": "No matter what ISIS does, no matter how barbaric and completely fucked their actions become, a carpet-bombing of the Middle East is not the answer and anyone in the free world who suggests so should be ashamed of themselves.", "id": 56256, "argument": "Maybe I am just preaching to the choir, maybe it's only the vocal minority I am seeing, but I need to hear a rational argument for this kind of response.

I understand the benefit of IPOs. I'm not arguing that the system would be better if we removed the opportunity for companies to generate capital from public investors. However, IPOs account for a small percentage of the daily activity that occurs on wall street. The majority of it is a game where players try to guess which tokens the general public will be more interested in tomorrow than they are today. Also, I'm not arguing that it's necessarily a scam. Rather, it's a Ponzi scheme that has more or less worked up to this point, and will continue to work as long as the financial sector can continue to coerce more and more people to put their money into the market. They do this through several avenues such as lobbying for tax benefits for investors, benefits to employers for offering 401k accounts and matching contributions, and a nationwide propaganda campaign that frightens people with the idea that they won't be able to retire unless they start investing in a market based retirement account early in life. I suppose this is the place where I start to lose people who believe in the market. I believe that when you put money into a market account and have your broker buy you shares of Google, Facebook, McDonalds etc. on the open market, it's misleading to say that you're buying a share of any of those companies. You're buying a token that you can do absolutely nothing with, other than sell it to somebody else later. Hopefully for more than you paid for it. You will be able to sell it later for more than you paid for it if the following 2 conditions are met The ratio of number of shares of that stock people are looking to buy number of shares of that stock people are looking to sell is higher on the day you go to sell it than it was on the day you bought it. There hasn't been a large withdrawal of money from the stock market game. In other words, if people get sick of playing this game and decide to take their money out to spend it elsewhere, the average price of shares across the board will drop, because there will be less money in the system to pay for it. I've heard people tie the trading price of stocks to the perceived value of the company with which the stock shares a name, but that doesn't legitimize the game as far as I'm concerned. The prices may reflect the perceived value of those stocks , but you could say that about any ponzi scheme. As long as the perceived value of the scheme kept going up which would happen as long as people kept investing money into it , it would qualify as a legitimate investment using the same logic. And with respect to dividends, there may have been a time when they accounted for a significant portion of a wall street investors return on investment, but that is not the case anymore. A lot of stocks don't offer them. For those that do when the trading price of the stock can often fluctuate on a daily basis a greater percentage than the annual yield, I would argue that the dividend is not a significant portion of this game. If I'm looking at this wrong, please . The idea of the stock market the one they sell you when you're learning about it is so awesome. The idea of trying to predict public opinion trends hysteria by dealing in imaginary tokens with no real value, and hoping that the financial institutions can continue to bring in more people so that your portfolio value appreciates, is not."}, {"conclusion": "I think professor keeting, from dead poets society, is a bad teacher.", "id": 61503, "argument": "I see him as a bad teacher for several reasons, mainly that he doesn't actually teach the boys anything during the time he is there if I was going through my final year of school I wouldn't want him as a teacher.

Racism is bad when it is expressed. If a person is racist but doesn't act on that racism, the world isn't any worse. However the world would be a lot worse if these people acted on their racism. Secondly, I currently find the notion of if people were openly racist then we could talk to them and solve the problem nonsensical. If a person who has been intimated into being a closet racist can't entertain ideas that drive away her his racism, do you really think she he will entertain those ideas if she he felt motivated to be vocal about her his prejudice? Personally, I don't feel let us counter their argument in public with facts and logic, if we can. But we'll never get to the bottom of it without being allowed to discuss it is a safe option. Many are also arguing that a person must have the right to say anything that she he wants. That's not something I disagre with.

Surely we would be in a perfect world since so much wrong has been done unto others and violence somehow educates them on how to be decent humans.

First, I fully believe that a body is an object once it is dead. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s something you just throw away without a care many objects people own are also treasured by them and greatly valued. Trophies, medals, paintings, etc. Object something with no value. But they are still, imo, just objects. I find the laws hypocritical when it comes to dealing with corpses. First, it\u2019s obvious that current laws are heavily influenced by religion. Cremating a body is legal. Burying a body in the dirt is legal. These practices are common in the big faiths of the world, which is why they\u2019re heavily tolerated. The hypocrisy is that people claim that fucking a corpse is a sign of extreme disrespect. The first thing wrong with this is that the act of sex is automatically deemed as a sign of hatred or being offensive. In life, sex is supposed to be about sensual intimacy and deep bonds, yet in death, it\u2019s suddenly about disrespect? This doesn\u2019t make sense. Secondly, why is it that literally burning a body to ashes to be thrown into some pot or letting a body rot in dirt six feet below is considered respectful, but having loving sex with a corpse is considered the opposite? The first two practices would be considered horrible if we did them to living people, but it\u2019s suddenly commemorative when they\u2019re dead. Meanwhile, sex is demonized. You can\u2019t screw a corpse, but you can definitely burn it to a crisp to show how \u201crespectful\u201d you are. Then there\u2019s the consent issue. One, consent is to prevent sexual assault in living people because that causes injuries and mental trauma both are impossible for a dead person. They are organically disintegrating and cannot feel. Like I said, I see corpses as objects. If you chopped off your hand, would you say it needs to be treated as a person? That detached limb has just as many thoughts and feelings as a corpse does. But even if someone were to get extremely hung up on the issue of consent, they should acknowledge that just like how a person can consent to being buried cremated before death, they can do the same with being used for sex as well. They even have the ability to consent in giving away entire estates and money caches in their will, so they can do the same for necrophiliacs in need. The only hard line I actually see is the health risk, but the people who cite this live in areas where Group One carcinogens like alcohol and processed meats are perfectly legal to consume. You can\u2019t claim that taking dangerous carcinogens should remain legal to the masses, but that fucking a corpse is a health code issue. It makes no sense. It\u2019s like a person with a scat fetish, and yet, even those types of people don\u2019t have legal issues with their fetish."}, {"conclusion": "Because it is very difficult to identify child pornography offenders these measures were necessary.", "id": 21829, "argument": "It occurs seldom that the FBI has the possibility to access such a significant amount of offenders and has to use this window of opportunity."}, {"conclusion": "Elected officials should lose their rights to privacy.", "id": 72236, "argument": "I think that as part of the requirements to run for office, candidates should have to fully disclose their personal information.

Furthermore, recording them without their consent should be legal, barring classified information which I hope they aren\u2019t sharing in unsecured places anyway. Since they are being elected to represent their fellow citizen\u2019s interests, those citizens deserve to know who they are really voting for. In a sense, elected officials should be considered a different kind of \u2018citizen\u2019, because of the influence they wield and where their influence comes from. I think that such a requirement would go a long way in weeding out some unsavory characters. Hopefully, under such a rule only people who truly have nothing to hide would be running for office. Their work is already largely transparent, with public hearings and sessions and laws that must be available for the public to read. Why not take it a step further and increase the transparency of the people doing the work as well? I understand that even elected officials are still considered citizens and have the same basic rights as everyone else. Thus this proposal would be a direct violation of the constitution.

Reddit does notice the dynamics of a relationship. It does notice the emotional investment or time investment. BUT Reddit does not FEEL the dynamics, or the time emotional investment. In fact, reddit is completely objective in it's perspective of the relationship, and bases it's opinion only on what is said in the OP. What is said by the OP is OP's best way of communicating the issue, but the reader cannot grasp or fully understand all aspects. The commenter will then draw from personal experiences and biases to offer their help. This help may actually be helpful, but it is only helpful by happenstance of a shared situation. To contrast, a therapist is trained to be nonjudgemental, and has years of experience helping people with their problems and coming to a viable solution compromise.

In it, I explained my viewpoint from financial, health, and moral perspectives. For those who are interested in seeing that thread, here is the link After pondering this issue further, I came to the conclusion that a perhaps even stronger case could be made for the NFL. I decided to make a sequel about the NFL as well. Here are my arguments again, for all three issues health, financial, moral . Health I don't think this is much of a debate on this issue, but perhaps someone can change my mind. In recent years there has been more and more light shed on the issue of CTE, a brain condition that results from suffering too many traumatic hits to the head. An increasingly troubling amount of football players have been diagnosed with this condition, most notably Junior Seau, Dave Duerson and Jovan Belcher. The consequences of this disease are terrifying, neurologists have said it is essentially having Alzheimer's in your 20s. This is just the tip of the iceberg, there's also the myriad of broken bones, torn ACLs, and muscle tears that happen almost every game in the NFL. The porn industry on the other hand, does an exceptional job of regulating the health of their performers. Porn performers are required to have strictly regulated bi weekly STD tests, and in the off chance that an STD is found, the performer will be sidelined until the issue is resolved, unlike football players who are constantly encouraged and pressured to play through severe injuries. The result is that the porn performers are 80 less likely to have an STD than the general public. Financial The most common rebuttal I hear when I bring up this topic is But NFL players make so much more money than porn stars If the overwhelming majority of NFL players were able to retire off the money made from their football careers, this argument would hold more water. But sadly, the exact opposite is true, 78 of NFL players go broke within 5 years of retiring. This is far too simplistic of an argument because it only factors in overall money made. It does not factor in the costs of being an NFL player The professional athlete culture, medical expenses, short career span, etc . I understand that the average career span of a porn star is short as well, but at least porn performers can get out of their industry with their bodies still intact. To be clear, I am not arguing that overall the porn industry is more lucrative than the NFL, I am just saying the money aspect of the argument for the NFL is far overrated when you consider the costs of playing professional football along with the fact that the NFL has never bothered to educate their players on financial literacy despite the absurd millions they make off them. Moral I thought the best way to compare these two industries morally would be to compare how they've handled an internal health crisis within their own industry. In 2013, an HIV outbreak was discovered in the porn industry. The industry responded by immediately starting a moratorium, halting all production, sacrificing their own paychecks, until the problem was resolved. The porn industry has always done a great job ensuring the safety of their performers, since the 1980's only 22 cases of HIV outbreaks in the porn industry have occurred. In comparison, there are an estimated 1,200,000 million people in the U.S general public who have it. Even if you account for population differences, the rate of HIV among porn stars is still many times lower. The NFL on the other hand, has known about the CTE issue for a long time and intentionally withheld information from their players to further their own business. They went out of their way to try and shame and discredit a neurologist by the name of Bennett Omalu who was simply doing his job and pointed out the troubling evidence found in autopsies of deceased former NFL players. The result was that 4500 former NFL players collectively sued the NFL for 765 million and won. So you have one industry that goes out of their way to ensure performer safety, and another one that goes out of their way to allow futher damage to the health of their players all for the sake of making more money.

For example, separate queues for people who need different amounts of service time and the like 10 items or less checkouts . but 90 of the time, a simple queue is the best way to determine who gets served first, not a scrum of people crowding around the service elbowing their way forward with no regard for politeness or etiquette, this is the kind of systems which promote different values for who gets served first, values like being pushy or being physically attractive, values which I believe pale in comparison to 'was there first'.

Are morals are completely created by the natural world. Starting with physics and how we came to be leading to biology with its principle of evolution. Much of what we believe is right in wrong has to do with what gave the best chance at extending an organisms genetic line. If an action is harmful to the completion of this goal, then the organisms less inclined to do so will more likely have its genetie materiel passed on. This works similarly with cultures. The groups of people that take on attitudes and beliefs that make a culture more invasive and enduring will be the ones to set the moral code. Furthermore, just as there is genetic drift in biology there are traits in a cultures moral code that spontaneously came to be. I know that all the various feelings i have on determining right or wrong fall apart when looked at objectively. Any thought of love, empathy, duty, honor, fear, or horror are just the axons and neurons firing in our brain. For simplicity's sake just because is the only valid argument for our moral codes.

It is cruel that man should breed and kill animals for his enjoyment whether as a dinner or a dance. But to my mind the life of an Iberian fighting bull, a thoroughbred animal which lives to a minimum age of four, roaming wild, feasting on Spain's finest pasture, never even seeing a man on foot, is far superior to that of the many thousands of British bulls whose far shorter lives are spent entirely in factory conditions and killed in grim abattoirs so that we can eat beefburgers.\"10 Moreover, Bulls are celebrated and honored in bullfighting. In most bullfighting countries, bulls are honored as mystical creatures of immense strength and beauty. Statues of bulls regularly stand outside of bullfighting stadiums, and depict the animals in the most majestic, strong, and beautiful way possible. These statues frequently standalone without an accompanying matador in the depiction.8 This respect and appreciation of the bull is a demonstration of the decency with which the art form treats the animal. All members of the bullfighting community, fighters and crowds alike, prize quick and relatively painless kills. If a matador fails to deliver such a kill, and the bull suffers needlessly, then he will be jeered and shamed. This dynamic demonstrates a clear sense of decency within the bullfighting community.8 Therefore there is no compelling moral reason to ban bullfighting, as in many ways it is either no worse or even superior to the other roles assigned to cows and bulls in Western cultures. If anything, the end result death for human enjoyment is the same if the animal is eaten or dies in a bullring, but at least in a bullfight the cultural value and artistic expression gives the creature's life and death a poetry and nobility which it will never have in a mechanical slaughterhouse or a butcher's shop."}, {"conclusion": "The 'sexual liberation' movement is based on an assumption that women, to be happy, need to be just like men.

It is very clear from the presentation that it is not something you can pick up and eat with your hands. This is one of my favourite pub foods, but I don't see any way it can justify calling itself a sandwich. There are many semantic debates one can have about what is and is not a sandwich, but sandwiches developed historically as a type of food men could eat with one hand while playing cards. In this case, there is no way to eat it without a knife and fork.

My opening statements in the  of this view are as follows Contemporary Religions Cause Human Rights Abuses All contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. Contemporary Christianity, when followed based on exact instructions, rather than its spirit that is, general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible , instructs its practitioners to kill, maim, and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal Christians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws, and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist , it is extremely common among more fundamentalist Christians to engage in such things as sexual orientation based discrimination, child abuse, and worse. Other religions, such as Islam, are just as bad, or even worse, in this respect. Some would argue that not all Christians are like this, but If There Is Religion, There Will Be Fundamentalists As society begins to leave its spiritual and superstitious roots behind and move on, many who are raised in, or have found, religion, leave behind fundamentalism and become more moderate or liberal. This may even extend to the point where the strict moral code of the religion is left behind, and instead, the religious belief is used for moral support or emotional uplifting. If we could just get all the fundies to follow in their footsteps, we'd be golden, right? The answer is no. As long as there are Christians, even in the loosest sense, there will be a few who open up their Bible and read what it has to say. Some of those people will convince their fellow Christians to become more fundamentalist. Others will simply become radicalized by themselves, becoming potential lone wolves. In any case, the further from Biblical morals their society is, the more fault they will see with it, and the more anger they will express. This anger could be expressed in highly non productive ways, a la Eric Rudolph. The only solution to this problem seems to be completely eradicating all traces of offending religions. Now, one could argue that this would bring about backlashes definitely from the fundies, and likely from the less strict religious, and perhaps even nonreligious human rights protectors who so valiantly guard the freedom of ideology they cherish, but that is also not a total stop to this, because We're Already On Our Way Think about how much progress developed countries have made away from religion in the last few decades. We have successfully removed religion from places where it is neither needed nor wanted, such as schools, in many cases. Of course, there are exceptions many classrooms are still religious in nature, and there will always be the religious folk who don't partake in such heathenery and instead homeschool their children so they can receive the necessary dose of brainwashing, but we have made a ton of progress. Despite the protests of the angry fundies, this is not poised to slow down, stop, or reverse at any point in the remotely foreseeable future. Does It Violate Freedom Of Expression? Not Really Freedom of Expression, like all rights, has its limits. The right to speak freely doesn't apply if you knowingly accuse someone of a crime they did not commit. The right to bear arms doesn't apply if you are manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. And, similarly, people cannot be allowed to hold irrational views which cause damage to society. Think about it like this. A person who believes black people are inferior to white people can go his entire life without ever committing a hate crime. Even though he considers black people his inferior, nothing about this views compels him to ever kill, steal from, or even refuse a job to a black person. His view is irrelevant, but it might predispose him to actions, which can be dealt with separately. Compare this to Christianity. The Bible actually encourages its followers to commit abuses against human rights, in many different forms. Because of this, a person who sincerely believes in the Bible is compelled to perform this actions, and harm others in doing so. The fundamentalist cannot reconcile these syncretic difficulties, and he is forced to obey his religious text over the law of the land because he cannot reconcile his beliefs. There Is No Evidence Any God Of The Contemporary Form Exists All these human rights abuses would be acceptable, even necessary , if it was proven that the God of the Bible or the Qu'ran, or the Torah was a real entity. However, not one shred of legitimate scientific evidence has ever been unearthed which would show the existence of such an entity. Instead, we are left with self contradictory texts which make many untrue predictions, to the point that anyone with even a moderate degree of knowledge of both theological and proper scientific fields could not reconcile its absurdity without resorting to willful ignorance. Most believers are ignorant in the traditional sense, in that they do not even know what they are truly supposed to be believing. End. Conclusion Contemporary religions are all irrational belief systems that are almost certainly untrue. They violate human rights by their very nature, and society would make significant progress if religion could be outlawed without unmanageable social backlash. Therefore, our opening statement is true."}, {"conclusion": "Hitler couldn't have taken over the world during World War 2.", "id": 53678, "argument": "Remembrance Day or Veteran's Day if you're American is coming up soon, and with it comes discussions about soldiers and wars. I've heard people tell me that if Britain or Russia or the United States, or whatever other country you care to name, hadn't stopped Hitler during World War Two, he would have gone on to take over the world. I just don't think this would have been possible for many reasons, most of the logistical. Before I get into them however, I'm just going to say that I am not diminishing the sacrifice of the brave men and women who gave their lives in the Second World War. I just don't think it would have turned out as bad as people make it out if we had lost. Conquering the whole world would be an extreme accomplishment that has yet to be achieved by any nation throughout all of history. Other countries that were said to have conquered the whole world such as Rome, Britain, or the Mongols actually only held a large portion of land and never anything close to the whole earth. These are the reasons why I don't believe the Nazis could have done it This is a weak point, but it bears mentioning because history has proved it true countless times. Never start a land war in Asia. Land wars in Asia almost never work out for the attackers Unless you're the Mongols as John Green would say . Conquering the whole world requires massive resources and supply lines. In order to take over everything you need enormously long supply lines that are constantly being bombarded by the enemy and it would take forever to get supplies to the front lines. While the Nazis would have been able to build more infrastructure as they went along, that would require an incredible amount of resources and time. I just don't think it's feasible. Lastly, Hitler would have needed the largest army ever assembled. If you're conquering the whole planet, you'll be losing an awful lot of soldiers. Even if he conscripted every able bodied person in Germany it wouldn't be enough. He'd have to take conscripts from the nations that he conquered and that's where the problem comes from. The people you force into service from defeated nations will have absolutely no loyalty to you or your army. They'll have no fighting spirit, no moral, and no devotion. There would have be countless mutinies and revolts from within Hitler's own ranks that he'd have to deal with on top of fighting at the front. The foreign conscripts might even change sides during a battle and attack their German commanders. An armed forces like that would be the biggest powder keg the world had ever seen. Sure, in the past countries have conscripted citizens of defeated nations, but never on such a scale as would be needed here.

This surprised me, because in the above video for example there are several possible valid reasons for the woman to be in the left lane, but also because I just don't get that upset when somebody is in the left lane. In my experience, if a driver is in the left lane unnecessarily and you get up behind them, they will move over. If they don't, a quick honk or a flash of the lights will do the trick. Anyways, I'm from Canada and it hadn't occurred to me that there might be a difference in driver culture until a recent trip I made to the US. I was driving for three or four hours on the beautifully paved divided highway interstate in desolate North Dakota. It was late at night and there was basically zero traffic. In that time I only passed two or three cars, and I was passed probably five or six times. edit To be clear, while driving down this empty highway, I'm definitely driving in the right lane like you should. Every time I was passed, I was shocked that the drivers came right up behind me before changing lanes to the left, despite the fact that there were no other cars in sight behind or in front of us. Even worse, once they had pulled out and passed, they would immediately pull back into the right lane in front of me, leaving less than a second of driving distance between my car and theirs. This made me physically uncomfortable, especially the latter, because I'm always conscious of leaving enough stopping distance between my car and those in front of me, and I know that I'm liable for anything that happens if we are in a collision in that scenario. If a deer jumped in front of their car a second after they pulled in front of me, and I rear ended them, I would be at fault. Annoyed, I made a point of immediately pulling into the left lane to drive for a while until the passing car was a safe distance in front so I could drive directly behind them again. There were no other cars around, so there was no reason to leave the left lane vacant for any amount of time that would cause danger of a rear end accident. In Canada our driving instructors teach you to leave 4 seconds of driving time between your car and the car in front of you, which is what I try to keep, both when following someone and when pulling in front of them. It was clear when I crossed the border into the US that the priority was not to keep that safe following distance, it was to keep the left lane clear. In a country that has thousands of miles of smooth and safe divided highway a luxury we do not take for granted in Canada , causing unnecessary danger by leaving one of those lanes vacant at all times for no reason seems like quite a shame."}, {"conclusion": "Andrew Jackson was a low class thug, a lousy president, and should be taken off the $20 bill.", "id": 120080, "argument": "I'm not really sure where to start, besides to say that the fact that America elected such a raving lunatic over men who were clearly much more competent, intelligent, and overall better human beings John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay in particular is a sad point in our history. J.Q. Adams was a brilliant statesman and a decent man who was loathed by Jackson and his followers because he was seen as aristocratic, which in normal speak really just means that he wasn't a backwoods savage like Jackson. Adams was from the North, had an excellent education, had a father who was President of the United States, and was a gentleman, which was enough to make Jacksonians dislike him. The only negative thing I can say about his personality is that he could be grumpy like his father, but I attribute that more to not liking attention than anything else. Henry Clay was also seen as aristocratic, but did much more for this country than Jackson ever did, especially considering his 1850 compromise delayed the dissolution of the Union and the Civil War by ten years. Clay fought tooth and nail to keep the Union together and prevent war. On the subject of Jackson, Thomas Jefferson said I am much alarmed at the prospect of seeing General Jackson become President. He is one of the most unfit men I know of for such a place. He has very little respect for laws or Constitutions. What's even sadder is what Jackson did when he was president. The arrogant disregard of Supreme Court decisions, forcible removal of some of the least troublesome Native Americans from their lands, and the intentional destruction of some of the pillars of the American economy are just a few of the achievements of Andrew Jackson, but it's fine because he was a common man and appealed to them.

I don't think they will ever account for more than 15 or so of the cars on the road. And, the major reason is that they will never alleviate traffic jams on the freeways, and will in fact, make the traffic jams worse. This will cause them to be hated by the masses. It will be an issue which self driving car makers will never be able to overcome. At least in the lifetime of anyone reading this. I believe there are additional reasons, but I'll stick to the traffic jam argument for this post. The causes of traffic jams are well known and quantifiable, although there is often the additional cause from the human element. Since we are discussing self driving cars, I will mostly ignore the human element of traffic jam causation. And no, the primary causes of traffic jams are NOT people driving badly or unreasonably. Normal free flow of traffic occurs when the number of cars that can travel over a segment of roadway is lower than a certain number, accounting for speed and following distance. The certain number varies depending on the road type freeway versus country road, for instance , the posted speed limit, and so on. This number is almost completely irrespective of human factors. For freeways, traffic engineers generally use a number of 2200 cars per hour, per lane, at a speed of 55 MPH as the maximum free flow capacity of a roadway segment given ideal conditions of daylight and dry road. Once the number of cars exceeds 2200 per hour per lane, then traffic jams begin to form. But, we must also note that if speeds are reduced, traffic jams begin to form with lower numbers of cars. And finally, if people attempt to maintain a longer following distance, again, traffic jams begin to form. We can see that traffic jams form when any or all of these factors are altered in a specific direction. Traffic jams are not necessarily caused solely by the number of cars on the road increasing beyond a certain point. It's also important to note that even if the speed limit is set higher than 55 MPH, the safe following distance also increases, so the free flow capacity of a road segment is not increased appreciably above 2200 vehicles per hour in a freeway lane. It's also known that humans will take risks to reduce traffic, often by exceeding the speed limit, reducing following distance, or both. And, this is where self driving cars will fail miserably when it comes to improving traffic. If we break the formation of traffic jams down into the major interrelated causes, we have speed, safe following distance, and the number of cars on the road. The number of cars on the road has no reason to change whether the cars are being driving by a human or not. It is presumed that people will continue the same driving patterns in this case, mostly to work and back , regardless. The speed of free flow traffic, if anything, will be reduced. Self driving cars are not keen, as far as I understand it, to exceed the speed limit. Further, there is no reason to believe that self driving cars will be like some kind of high speed train, where even when there are more cars than roads can typically carry, they can zip along at highway speeds. This is the most important misunderstanding I think people have about them. And finally, there is safe following distance. Again, as I understand it, the following distance of self driving cars would be fairly set. They don't reduce this distance with the idea of pushing more cars over a certain road segment. So, there is nothing above that would serve to alleviate traffic jams. The road can only carry so many cars at a certain speed, before jams occur. If anything, humans serve to alleviate traffic a little because they are willing to follow closer and take other risks. Self driving cars, when driving more by the book will simply cause bigger traffic jams. I have heard arguments that because the cars are driven by computer, they can be more systematic. They don't slow down at the end of a freeway entrance ramp, for instance they can simply merge right in between two other cars, and the other cars won't have to slow down. This view is absolutely unfounded. It might work if all the cars were being driven by a central computer, but these self driving cars are not connected. They don't communicate. They have no idea what the other cars will do, so they react, even if quickly. So, to say that cars will mesh together and join the flowing traffic is not accurate. Further, even if they could, there is still the issue that beyond a certain number of cars, the road simply can't handle a traffic load safely, so jams will start to occur. We will never see a long line of bumper to bumper self driving cars tooling along at freeway speeds during rush hour. The main argument that I hear for self driving cars alleviating traffic is that they eliminate the human elements like random braking which causes chain reaction slowing, erratic lane changes, slowing down simply in anticipation of traffic because there's traffic in a certain spot every day, fewer accidents, and so on. And while these may well be eliminated or greatly reduced, those human elements are not the primary causes of traffic jams. So, as more and more self driving cars hit the road, and traffic jams get worse, they will start to get a very negative reputation. People will simply not want them in any great numbers because of the stigma. And, they will never be a large percentage of cars on the road. My guess is that they will not ever gain more than 15 of the total cars on the road in the lifetime of anyone reading this, and even if they do hit 15 , I think sales will start to decline over time due to the stigma of traffic makers or whatever the term will be. In order to change my view, I need a convincing argument on how self driving cars will be no worse for traffic than they are today. To simply says computers are better drivers will not be convincing to me. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

This guy does a better job at explaining it gt It means that if you value intelligence, technology, or understanding the universe then you realize that we, as humans, are not only the very best that the universe has to offer, but that it's all on us. If we screw up then the universe will remain a mystery. It makes us the one single light of reason in an incomprehensibly large and dark room. gt And it means that we are alone in facing our problems, alone in experiencing war and hate and all the darkness that comes from intelligence misused, it means no one and nothing is going to show up and say Hey humanity, you've done well you know? You screwed up some places, but so did we. gt For me the idea that humanity is the only glimmer of intelligence in the universe makes all our petty squabbles and politics more damning. It means that the people in power are risking stakes they cannot comprehend for gains so short term that they're not even visible on a geological scale, much less a cosmic one. Imagine all that humanity could accomplish, the colonies of life and reason spreading throughout the cosmos, every planet we visit and terraform would bring new and unique life into the universe, imagine the wonders we could create and then realize that we risk it all over things which won't matter in 40 years or which would be better solved using reason. Add to it the fact that we risk all of that potential not only for ourselves but for the universe at large, and it is an awesome responsibility. u VorDresden gt Source"}, {"conclusion": "The problem with contraception related education is not that people need to know it exists, but how to use it properly.", "id": 92823, "argument": "As of 2003, nearly half of the adult US population had inadequate literacy which means that the majority of people probably are unable to parse information on complicated drug labels.

Obviously Adam West, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney didn't nail the role. The best contenders I suppose are Christian Bale and Ben Affleck, but neither of them really went beyond a decent performance in my opinion. Christian Bale made a great Bruce Wayne, but his Batman was over the top and I can't stand the voice he chose to go with. I prefer Ben Affleck's a little bit more, but I still don't think he really brought Batman to life. He also did things out of character for the spirit of Batman branding enemies, killing people , but I guess that's on the screenwriters and director. But still, it makes it harder to get behind Affleck's Batman. It's kind of odd because the Joker has Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Mark Hamill all doing extraordinary jobs, so Batman's primary villain has been done well. And his counterpart Superman the other most popular superhero from DC , has arguably been done well by Christopher Reeve, Brandon Routh, and Henry Cavill. I at least think each of their portrayals of Superman beats any I've seen of Batman. So why does Batman seem to be the exception? Anyways, feel free to change my view. If there is a strong portrayal of Batman I'm missing, let me know, or if you think I'm underestimating one of the actors I listed who played Batman, explain to me why.

This is far too many for such a limited discipline. I believe the only reason for this overstuffed category is American bribing of the Olympic committee in the 1960s as part of a cold war effort to overtake the USSR on the medal table. Swimming is a fairly limited discipline requiring a limited skill set that can be applied to a majority of the events, this can be seen by looking at the most decorated Olympians list, 7 of the top 20 are swimmers and each one of them is American, athletics by comparison has only 1. Once you are good at one swimming event you can compete competitively in a large number of them. This limits the number of winners and is bad for viewers as they just watch the same group of elite athletes compete though the various lengths with different strokes. The only people taking joy out of this are American supporters who regularly dominate. I think the reason for having so many of these events is because in the 1960s America wanted to be able to produce an event category which would produce a large number of gold medals for them which in turn would allow them to topple the USSR from the top of the medal table, who had won in both 1956 and 1960. You can see this happening in the jump from the number of swimming events in 1960\u20131968 going from 15\u201329 in just 2 Olympics this 14 event increase is only matched by the 1896 1904 jump from 12 25 athletics events. Americans choose swimming over the other categories because it requires a large amount of money to compete, the construction of large swimming pools in which to get regular practise is not something a lot of countries can afford so the chance of a poor nation producing top level swimmers is low compared to a cheaper sport like running. Also because of the high number of large cites and sports colleges in America 1 pool is capable of servicing a high number of athletes compared to a country with fewer high population cities e.g. the USSR. The addition of these extra swimming events has not produced better sport, but has added to the US domination of the medal table, which they continue to profit from with swimming going up to 35 events, whereas the USSR\u2019s solution of doping has rightly earned them a reputation that haunts them to this day. But maybe I am wrong and 35 swimming events are not too many and the reason it increased was not underhand dealing. EDIT People have pointed out that the amount of swimming events added are likely down to the amount of money that could be made through television CBS paying 394,000 3260000 in today's dollars to show the 1960 games. Swimming is also arguably a good sport to commercialise, quick lots of breaks. And since broadcasting only began in the 1960s and was biggest in America with BBC only regularly broadcasting from 1968, the IOC would want to appeal to americans so added more events that americans are likely to win.

And once we settle down in a particular neighborhood with particular friends, we would be unsettled to find that we can no longer afford to live in that neighborhood and have to move. But that's stress due to change, not due to lack of wealth as such, and, over time, we can get used to change as long as we have and feel confident that we will continue to have food and shelter for ourselves and our family. That presumably means not only that we have a house and a grocery nearby, but also that we have a steady source of income sufficient to put food on the table, and a source of education for our children so that they will be able to follow in our footsteps. In other words, poverty can certainly cause unhappiness, but, once we are out of poverty, wealth does not cause happiness. We could be wealthy and happy, wealthy and unhappy, lower middle class and happy, or lower middle class and unhappy. As long as we are out of poverty and not in fear of falling back into poverty, we have just as much chance of being happy as a millionaire or billionaire. On the other hand, I also don't believe that more money brings less happiness. There are happy millionaires and happy billionaires.

It's often followed up with the question When was America great ? In the past I've tried to indicate certain decades where American prosperity existed but would often find myself in contradictions. Sure the 50's in the U.S. gave many Americans the ability to have amazing quality of lives, disposable income prosperity. At the same time many Americans were subjugated to racist policies and were left without the prosperity their fellow Americans acquired. The fundamental reality that America was great for some but not for others, complicated the question when was it last great . One could argue that America has never been great for everybody in America. Even today people would claim that America isn't representing everyone. This in my view creates a circumstance where you can't truly answer the question based on time frame, since it's always going to be met with qualifiers. This got me thinking about what things in America were once great and how we could return to attaining those things. To me that's what my answer became, and I wonder if others would agree and if not why aren't these things reflective of America returning to greatness. Below is my list of things that were lost and that which I was yearning for returning when thinking about Making America Great Again. First and foremost I felt that the past 2 decades of nation building and fighting wars had created a negative opinion of America for many, both inside and outside of its borders. Once considered the beacon for freedom and opportunity, America was now being viewed as an oppressor and a colonist. The America I had wanted to return to was one that hailed human rights, instead of abusing them. One that created opportunity and prosperity, instead of killing hundreds of thousands. With the recent wars, came the perception of our military and our soldiers. Once we all agreed that these were heroes who commanded our respect. As the War in Iraq unfolded this objective view was no longer so objective. Narratives of these soldiers being war crazed, murderous colonists were commonplace. Especially on forums like reddit. I yearned for the return of our military being praised, instead of chastised. In a similar vain, as a kid police officers were always people to be idolized. They were the first responders, the heroes who would run towards danger to protect others while the rest of us backed away. As the decades unfolded the police were no longer being described in such a way. Instead of praising their heroism, narratives about racist policing policies and injustices took up most of the oxygen on the topic. I yearned for a society that once again praised our police and held them in high regard. As the decades unfolded I watched as people's incomes stagnated while rents and costs of living continued to rise. Our purchasing power as individuals diminished and it was nearly impossible to survive on just one income. I yearned for the return of a society where our quality of life wouldn't demand working 60 hour weeks for crumbs and no vacations. I looked at America's role on the world stage and wondered what role it really had anymore. We were in a globalized reality now. The ease of which people could move around, the technological revolution and the internet, America was no longer just America, it was now a piece of a greater puzzle. Sure our influence could still be felt across the globe from our movies and music, from our fashion McDonalds, but our identity was confusing. Were we still the great Democratic experiment? Or were we just another country? I yearned for America to regain its stance as a leader in the world not through wars, but through ideals. I felt we lost this along the way. When I think about Making America Great Again, these were the things I was hoping would return to our great nation. Maybe there's other examples of things you too have seen go by the way side as time goes on and society changes. But when it comes to Making America Great Again these are the first things that come to my mind.

Because of this need, animals are bred for the purpose of living their lives in laboratories. They lack any type of life enrichment besides being able to eat the tested product and drink water. And the most disheartening thing is that they are killed at the end of the experiments. They don't get to be released to some kind of animal sanctuary or cared for as pets. They are laboratory instruments that will be killed after their purpose has been served. Some might say we need to test this food in case it might harm us. However, after hundreds of independent and hundreds more of corporate testing, there has been not one single instance of harm because of a genetically engineered food. Even mechanisms for how they might harm us have not been identified. Additionally, we have been tinkering with the genetics of food and other plants for nearly all of human agriculture. We blast things with radiation and other chemicals, but for some reason only genetic engineering needs to be tested in this cruel, inhumane and unnecessary way. If animals don't get your sympathy, then consider the costs of this testing. It raises barriers to entry for companies, and private initiatives are spending millions of dollars on testing when they could be used for greater humanitarian goals. We have sufficient technology to identify potentially harmful proteins, and an adequate knowledge of toxicity to understand that genetic engineering does not pose any more risks than conventional breeding. So why is this mandatory testing in place? I can only think of the anti GM activists who keep chanting MORE TESTING , totally uncaring to the true costs their actions have on animals and animal welfare. I am rather cynical.

Because in some cases, children should absolutely be separated from their parents . If the parents are abusive, a child should be separated from them. The family court system has no problem granting sole custody of a child to one parent. Justified or not, this counts as separating a child from part of their family. Where are the critics with their new found message when this occurs? It seems as if it's completely fine to separate a child from their parents when the parent is deemed to be unfit is a criminal, so, no, children should not always be kept with their parents.

If you can't do one of these things, it should be reflected in your score because that is what the test is trying to show colleges. Whether you can't read quickly because you are dyslexic, you can't focus well, or you just aren't good at reading doesn't seem to be of that much relevance to the purpose for which colleges want test scores, which is presumably to see if you have the abilities and skills necessary to succeed in their classes. A common argument seems to be that these skills aren't important and mastery of them doesn't indicate people who have great ideas, are driven, or will succeed in college or life. This is absolutely true, but then we should get rid of this style of standardized testing altogether instead of punishing students who have minor problems testing quickly and giving accommodations to those with huge problems testing quickly. If colleges want this information and College Board and the ACT have agreed to give it to them, they should at least give it to them accurately or have an asterisk or letter accompanying the scores to reflect the unusual testing conditions. If you are illiterate for any reason, colleges should be told that in some form on a test of reading speed and ability. If you get the questions read out loud to you and answer verbally, which is not an uncommon accommodation at my school, colleges should see that information along with your score. Especially on the ACT, where the questions are fairly simple and time is often the main factor in the reading comprehension and science sections, extra time, getting questions read to you at your own pace, and even in some cases unlimited time are enormous benefits that can lead to perfect scores. Percentile is hugely important in SAT and ACT scores and affects and outlying scores affect everyone's score. The main problem with accommodations based on learning disabilities is that it is hugely class based and leads to more unfair advantages and opportunities for cheating for privileged kids with pushy parents. As a student at a fairly elite private school where a majority of kids are applying to highly selective universities and almost half of the student population gets accommodations of some kind on standardized tests, I hear kids and parents talking all the time about strategies to get accommodations, a process that requires a lot of time and money from involved parents concerned with college admissions, attentive teachers in small classes, tutors, and school learning specialists and college counselors, none of which are available to many kids in this country, many of whom probably have real learning problems that go undiagnosed. Many kids in my class have perfect 2400s or 36s earned with accommodations, and a huge percentage of the kids at my school have accommodations of some sort. In some parts of the country, the SAT is treated as a literacy test for state or community college admission, and yet in my extremely wealthy community, kids get questions read out loud to them if they read slower than the average kid their age. It doesn't make sense to me. I can't help feeling that this system isn't fair, it's biased against kids and families who need the most help, and it prevents the standardized test from doing its job. I'm starting to feel really guilty about this, though, and I think it probably is coming from the frustration of the standardized test process.

I believe that snitching on people his highly unethical unless if they are committing or going to commit a violent act that harms others in anyway murder, rape, stealing, you get the idea . Keep in mind that I am not referring to whistle blowing companies or the government which I believe is a different issue in on itself like Edward Snowden . I am referring to snitching on an individual or a very few amount of individuals. I am referring to things like cheating on a test or calling the cops for someone who is smoking weed. Things that you get no benefit from for snitching on people from. It is ok to think these things are unethical, but if someone is not disurbing harrassing harming you, then it is not your business what they are doing. It is just bad karma although karma may or may not exist if you snitch on people for cheating on a test for an example. If they get expelled and found out you snitched on them, they have a pretty good reason to kill you, which leads to the point that snitching is inherently dangerous. Also maybe you will find yourself cheating or doing something unethical at some point in your life? Is it fair that someone ruins your life for a mistake you are making? There is no point in it. You will always meet shitty people in life. A lot of people respect ethical people, there is not doubt about that. However, people are pretty divided 50 50 on snitches I don't have statistics on this, I am just making a very rough observation from my life . If I was an employer and I had an employee that snitched on people all the time, I wouldn't want him working for me and I would fire him. It says a lot about his her character and they might snitch to your boss, its unfair. One day you might do something that is borderline or not so ethical and you will be pissed if someone squealed on you. Imagine if a civilian had a radar detector in his her car and took pictures of people's license plates while they were speeding and they send it to the police station so they can write tickets. That would be pretty fucked up would it not? This is more of a philosophical debate, but not everyone is clean, including you and me. Even if you are very ethical, you might do something in your life that is borderline or not so ethical. Not everyone is a saint, we are all humans. What if I had access to your computer and see that you torrented a lot of things and took a screenshot and then sent it to your internet service provider theoretically of course ? Isn't that pretty fucked up? Of course it is. If no one is bothering you than just mind your own business. Because if you are a snitch, one day you might piss off a gang member or a person who would kill you or destroy your life to get vengeance. Snitching is bad and cheating is bad, but I would have to say snitching is worse on this one although many would disagree. I am making this post because I feel like it is something most of us can relate to. We have all met this type of person in life. What baffles my mind is that snitches are usually praised by teachers, bosses, and other authority figures in society. Why is that? Am I the only one who has noticed that? Anyway, try and change my view EDIT 1 I also want to make another point. I was in the US army for 3 years. When I was private E1 E3 I had someone in my squad who was an E 4 a specialist, not a leader who snitched on me all the time to the team and squad leader. I would get snitched for very little things simple private mistakes that those that have been in the military, nothing serious and I would get smoked very badly smoked means they would torture you through exercise so you learn your lesson . This person would make me so angry and at the time I was thinking if I am in a fire fight with this guy and he needed my help, would I put in a lot of effort to help him or let him die? I know this is fucked up, but it was a dark thought in my head, but it made for a good point. Is it a good idea to make people hate you when you might need them one day? For snitches reading this, you may never know when you need help from the people you are snitching. If they hate you, then snitching will bite you back in the ass. I hated that guy so much. Anyway, for those who try to change my view I won't assume you are a snitch, I am just making an anecdote. EDIT 2 I need to clarify, if people are cheating on an exam and using you and your paper directly to cheat on their exam, then it is ok to ask the professor to move or call the person out because it is harming you directly. As a student I agree with this. I forgot to include this. EDIT 3 Some of make good points, but a lot of you really makes me misanthropic. If a lot of you think its ok to snitch on your Jewish neighbors during the holocaust because because you feel obligated as a German to do the right thing and turn them in, then I don't think I want to live on this planet anymore."}, {"conclusion": "The classical definition of God is contradictory or incoherent, and thus God cannot in principle exist.", "id": 65756, "argument": "As man created artificial intelligence, robots & automatons which follow his instructions blindly evidently without criticizing, blaming or going against him, it is unlikely God would be so foolish to have created conscious beings with free will many of whom don\u2019t believe He exists, criticize Him, even blame, go against or harm Him, which may indicate that nature, e.g., humans, is not the creation of God/God does not exist."}, {"conclusion": "The supply of uranium needed for nuclear power is not actually unlimited, renewable or sustainable", "id": 14161, "argument": "The projected lifespan of uranium must be compared to that of oil, gas and coal which are irrefutably running out.

To put things in perspective, I am very old school and have never used a dating site, and I am not really into social media at all, so it's possible that I am missing some underlying understanding of this. Basically, I am aware that people use all kinds of filters and angles to create very stylized and attractive looking photos of themselves, even when they look nothing like it in real life. I don't understand what this accomplishes. If you are doing it on a dating site, all that will happen is that someone's first real life impression of you will be disappointment even if you actually look ok . If you do it on social media, people who know what you look like will see your photo and think that it looks nothing like you. I can't believe that anyone will actually end up finding you more attractive just because of a misleading photo. I understand that photos are not the best representation of a person anyway, and everyone will go with the one where they look their best, but there is a difference between looking like yourself on a good day and looking like someone else. I even assume this would backfire on people, because it sends a message that they weren't even able to find one decent natural photograph of themselves, so they probably don't think that they look good. Why would someone who thinks this way post endless photos of themselves though? The only exception I can find is for people who aspire to make some kind of business or get fame out of posting their photos, so they don't expect their followers to ever see them in real life. I think poorly of these aspiring celebrities, but at least I understand the motivation still I can't understand how this talent works when it's not a very competitive skill. How can one person even stand out among all the others who are doing the same thing? Finally, even if you fool a few people who never see you in real life, what kind of gratification can you get from knowing that people like the looks you don't really have? Edit yes, using make up to alter your features is included in this category. gt Tldr People who are posting selfies that are filtered, photoshopped or otherwise altered using odd lens angles, making faces on social media or dating sites are misguided because it won't make anyone who sees them in real life find them more attractive.

The admins seem to be acting as though these related subreddits are a form of ban evasion, and most people seem to agree. Meanwhile, the claim continues to be that they are only banning rule breakers, not censoring ideas. What disturbs me about this is that there is no such thing as subreddit ban evasion. A subreddit is not a person, it is a topic of conversation. If, after a particular subreddit is banned for breaking the rules, people go on to set up new subreddits with the same topic of conversation shouldn't that subreddit have the same opportunity to follow the rules as any other? If those mods can do a better job, shouldn't they get the chance? On the other hand, if simply setting up a new subreddit for the same topic is treated as ban evasion, and immediately banned as well, then isn't that exactly equivalent to banning the topic? If the admins are banning all subreddits for a particular topic of conversation, a particular idea, and for no other reason then being for that topic, being that idea then isn't that objectively the banning of the idea? I am very disturbed at the thought that all those folks crying censorship might actually be right this time, and even more so at the thought that the admins might actually be lying to us. I don't want this to be the case, but I cannot see a reasonable alternative explanation. Please, change my view. EDIT Just to be clear, I'm not necessarily saying they shouldn't have banned those subreddits or that they should have either , I'm just saying that what they are doing is in fact entirely materially equivalent to banning the idea, which they claim not to be doing. As for the question of evidence for the fact that they are in fact banning subreddits simply because of their topic, I'll use one unique example that proves it particularly well Consider the fact that they accidentally banned r whalewatchers for a short time a two year old subreddit that's actually about whale watching , simply because trolls posted some FPH related content which the mods would have obviously removed anyway . If they were only banning rule breakers, how could r whalewatchers, a two year old subreddit that couldn't possibly have had evidence of rule breaking associated with it, have earned a banning even if they did mistakenly think it was dedicated to hating fat people? I can find no reasonable explanation as to how that mistake could even have been possible if they were only banning rule breakers and not banning ideas."}, {"conclusion": "They sustain and develop complex solutions as have resources to do so", "id": 11779, "argument": "One relevant example: The theory of evolution makes it impossible for the existence of Adam and Eve as described in Genesis."}, {"conclusion": "Collegiate sports do more harm than good in regards to the universities and their students.", "id": 68383, "argument": "My opinion is that college sports do more harm than good to the universities and their students and sports and post grad education should not be associated with each other. I believe sports are extremely irrelevant to the goals of a university to educate students, and because of this they hurt students and the university in three major ways 1 they are a waste of university resources, 2 they are a detriment to all students who choose not to be athletes, and 3 they are a detriment to athletes themselves. 1 Let's start by saying that collegiate sports are almost never a way to earn money for the university. They at best almost pay for themselves. This is especially true for all division 2 or lower universities. They may rake in donations but those donations are usually self centered back towards the very programs themselves. Only a small fraction of sports earned donations make it out of the athletic programs. This being said, the programs as a whole cost the university money and there is no way around that fact. Even if the university sells tens of thousands of stadium tickets on football Saturday, it is nothing compared to all of the expenses of all the other smaller less popular sports. Tens of millions of dollars are being spent on stadiums, swimming pools, fields, and equipment. All of which will be used by the only of fractions of a student body. This money could be used in more education focused purchases or to reduce tuition as a whole. It kills me to think of how much money I spent for my degree went to the bull shit football team no one ever watched and for the fields and equipment reserved for athletes only. 2 This brings me to my next point that collegiate sports hurt non athlete students. Colleges have pretty much always given a large upper hand to their athletes over their normal student body. We as a culture praise the athlete for no realistic reason. Athletic Scholarships are a great example of the point I'm trying to make. Why for what reason ever should someone's athletic ability allow them to earn a better and easier access to a university over someone else who is more apt to learn and prove their value as a student? I'm not saying colleges don't give out education based scholarships, I'm just illustrating the point that they could give out more education based scholarships if they weren't giving out athletic scholarships. I think a students athletic ability has nothing to do with their ability as a student so there is no reason to give financial aid to a student merely based on their athletic ability. It would be like allowing a fat guy to train with the Olympic basket ball team just because he got a 4.0 in high school. 3 Lastly, and this is where my views get a little more controversial, but I think for the majority of collegiate athletes, their sport does them more harm than good. A fraction of a percent end up going professional, yet all around, big to small, all universities are packed with student athletes. These sports may build character , but compared to the damage they do to students, I don't think it's worth it. I believe sports warp students priorities and distract from their education. The amount of time in practice, or missed classes due to games, or the lack of focus during class because your too tired from all the tough work. Physical injuries must also be taken into account. A large portion of student athletes will be injured in ways that will permanently effect their bodies for the rest of their lives. ACL tears, concussions, tore rotator cuffs, spine and nerve damage, the possibilities are endless. TL DR I don't see any connection between getting an education and athletics, and the costs out weigh the benefits. Please let me know what I'm missing here. Also I'm writing this at four in the morning because I can't sleep. My grammar and spelling are at about 10 of my normal capacity but please don't let that distract you from what I am saying."}, {"conclusion": "Cheerleaders should be the ones to decide whether they are even feeling objectified and if so, whether this is a sufficient reason for them to leave their profession.", "id": 80273, "argument": "Considering that there are still many professional cheerleaders today one would assume they either do not feel objectified or the objectification is not bad enough to make them leave their job."}, {"conclusion": "The Electoral College's continued problem of allowing for presidents who did not win the popular vote justifies it's abolition.", "id": 6900, "argument": "It's in human nature and not only human as a biological imperative that one will try and preserve it's genes by offering competitive advantages to its descendants.

I'll be the first to say it. And I also recognize the history of pride. That most of it is founded on the stonewall riots and resistence against oppressive authority.

I think that cops, so long as they understand their history with us, and support us, and do what they were meant to do rather than treating us like shit. Allowing them at pride is a truce of sorts. And one of the first steps to humanizing us, and helping cops and the system to recognize our humanity, is an important aspect of advancing and maintaining our civil rights and eliminating the us vs them mentality. I realize that it shouldn't be our job to babysit and educate them on why they shouldn't brutalize us. But unfortunately, it is . To give a bit of anecdote, I'll add that I also think they're neccesary, to an extent, for protection.

Trans people should be respected and treated as equals irrespective of biological underpinnings.", "id": 63551, "argument": "There has been research published in the recent past that demonstrates some degree of correlation between certain physical features and a person identifying as trans. However, we are a long way from anything that would determine conclusively that all people who identify as trans have any unique, specific physical trait or that anyone with any particular physical trait will necessarily identify as trans. I understand that finding such a physical trait would swiftly give trans people insular class status in the US, which is very valuable in the fight for rights and recognition by government. However, I would argue that even if such a trait were found, it would be unlikely that every person who has ever identified as trans would have it. I would argue that even trans people without any biological underpinnings or predisposition deserve every bit as much recognition and respect as any other citizen trans or not. Suggesting that there must be some kind of biological trait that causes people to be trans is disrespectful and belittling of trans people and of the complexity of humans. EDIT Just to be abundantly clear, I am not saying that any study of the biological underpinnings of trans identity is necessarily disrespectful of trans people. However, I am suggesting that this issue is disrespectful of trans people as it is related to their rights and status within society. When another human is expressing themselves within their human rights, it is disrespectful to attempt to dissect them in an attempt to figure out what physical abnormality must be driving them. They should simply be given the same respect and status as everyone else. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

This is something I had been thinking about recently, but I honestly don't believe I've ever heard a criticism of the Kim Kardashian or the Kardashian family that isn't rooted in some form of sexism or racism. Kim Kardashian is only famous because she released a sex tape. Umm who cares? You think in a more progressive culture, people would stop slut shaming but I'm still seeing this as a very common sentiment, even among self proclaimed feminists. It's literally just porn. Why is it a big deal that she released a sex tape of herself? There's plenty of people on YouTube and Twitch that make millions of dollars screaming into a microphone and playing videogames. Why is releasing a sex tape an illegitimate way of getting famous? The Kardashians have no talent. Since when has talent ever been an inherent precursor to becoming famous? I always find it interesting that high profile women always have to justify their high profile. We completely ignore mediocre men that get famous based on absolutely nothing but their looks. But in order for a woman to be famous, there has to be some sort of specific reason. They dance, sing, are funny, entertainers, musicians, they model, etc. Plus, this argument does totally undermine that what they do does take a certain degree of talent and social awareness to best exhibit their brand. OMG THEY DATE BLACK MEN I'd say about half of Kardashian hatred is rooted in the fact that most of them date black men. Most of the jokes I've seen about all of them is some sort of references to their affinity towards black men but why the fuck does this matter? If they only dated white dudes, no one would even bring it up and people would find a different reason to disparage them. But the fact that a lot of them are high profile and engage in interracial relationships obviously makes a ton of people uncomfortable. White people see them a race traitors. A lot of black people see them as culture vultures and say that anyone dating a Kardashian is in the sunken place . Again, a progressive, non racist society would not be making these sort of moral judgements just because some of them are in interracial relationships. Kim Kardashian posted a naked picture of herself Again, why does this matter? I remember she got a ton a shit for posting that picture on Instagram. Feminism is supposed to be about supporting women in however they choose to express themselves, as long as it isn't hurting anyone. She hurt no one by posting that picture. Yet, vocal feminist entertainers got pissed at her for attention seeking behavior . This is as sexist as it comes. Shaming a woman for taking pride in their body and demanding that they cover up is sexist. Yet, this sentiment was common in progressive circles. These are the usual arguments I've seen against Kim and their entire family.

The Senators are appointed for life on advice of the PM, and the body has few meaningful powers. So it is basically a plum to hand out to political favorites, and it is as corrupt as you'd expect from that. Because it is not a democratically elected body, it does not have the political capital or legitimacy to block bills passed by the Commons. They can force the Commons to vote on amendments and delay bills, but if the Commons really wants a bill, they get it. Any attempt otherwise would be a constitutional crisis. So it doesn't do much, is highly corrupt, and has no democratic legitimacy. The obvious alternative to what I'm proposing is to make Senators elected by some fashion. But this would create a greater potential for constitutional crises, or else fundamentally alter the nature of Canadian governance. If the Senate is elected, it would have the democratic legitimacy to block bills, including budget bills. If the Senate had this power, it would mean that the government could fail to pass a budget due to an impasse between Commons and Senate. In this event, you would need to resolve the impasse somehow. Currently, this would mean an election. But does that mean both houses get elected? If so, how is that different from just having a bigger Commons? And does the Senate leader have the power to direct the Governor General or Queen in any way? If so, this would be a mess. If not, what is the justification for two democratically elected bodies being differentially powered? If the Liberals win the Commons, and the Conservatives win the Senate, who has the rightful claim to govern Canada? Edit to add I know Australia has an elected Senate, but that has caused constitutional crises in the past and has the potential to in future Since the Senate does so little already, it seems the more cautious and prudent approach would be to abolish it.

The whole point of the automate everything bathroom is to minimize contact between the user and anything in the bathroom itself. This is for good reason public bathrooms are unsanitary and gross. But the automatic toilet has some drawbacks Cost Automatic toilets require a sensor and some amount of other hardware software, along with all of the other toilet components, and will thus be more expensive than a regular toilet. Efficiency I estimate that the automatic toilets I use, at least when going number 2, flush about 25 of the time before I am finished and then again at the end. This usually occurs at the very beginning when I stand in front of the toilet, place paper on the top, and prepare to sit down. Every extra flush here is a waste of water. I have never accidently flushed a manual toilet. Frustration Because I use a paper cover when sitting down placebo or no any time the toilet prematurely flushes I am forced to let that cover get sucked away and then put another on before the flush cycle resets. The automayic toilet is requiring extra work to use it at all. There is also the possibility of flushing while still sitting. EDIT Additional Note Repair Your average plumber cannot replace the fancy electronic parts on a toilet. They are all proprietary and take more expertise and money to fix. Meanwhile a foot operated toilet has all of the same important qualities as a regular toilet cost, efficiency, etc. with none of the drawbacks. Namely, the contact between bathroom and user is negated by using shoes and even without, pushing a foot pedal barefoot is less gross than using your hand . There is no good reason for the average bathroom user to support migrating to automatic toilets over mechanical foot operated toilets. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

If a sentient being comes into existence in our world, it is highly probable that they won't be one of the lucky few with easy lives. What's worse, even easy lives are not necessarily better than non existence. From an objective perspective, birth is a net disadvantage since you are doomed to experience a number of shitty qualia instead of simply not existing. When parents decide to give birth, they always do so for their own satisfaction or goals. A person who is not born yet cannot have needs or exercise an influence on the world. Therefore, by giving birth, the parents needlessly create additional suffering. Generally the argument is that life is somehow beautiful and that a person is lucky to be alive to experience the fleeting moments of satisfaction available. I don't think this reasoning works because if a person had never been born, no such need would have been created. There would be no imperative to have meaningful experiences or anything of the sort. Suffering would be physically impossible, in fact there would be no concept of it. That said, I understand people who value birth and life, for the simple reason that a culture has to value these things in order to have survived this long. However, from a moral point of view, giving birth is extremely callous and selfish. From an emotional point of view, it's still highly popular.

But even if this doesn't happen everyone quitting is unlikely. Employers know that unemployment pays much less than employment. As we explained previously each side has a BATNA and should form an opinion on what is the other side's BATNA. Prop. is saying that employers believe that a worker wants a 10% raise more than he wants a 100% of his salary. If there were 0% unemployment, all workers leaving overnight would be credible but in Greece, the govrnment knows better. What workers think their employer's BATNA is? they know their employers know they won't quit.Without a right to go on strikethey know their employers know they themselves have the leverage. Labor legislation and unions were born in the industrial age precisely so workers wouldn't have to choose between food and dignity. Two points about choosing the arbitrator: 1The prop didn't say when it would be chosen. Often the arbitrator is already in the contract when it's first signed. It's mutually agreed, the arbitrator might be the company's CEO. Or maybe a governmental agency. 2If it's chosen later problems persist. Mutually agreed upon arbitrators puts workers at the mercy of their employers. Employers can reject every arbitrator proposed by the workers for years, thus avoiding any ruling. And the opposite: they can propose arbitrators that they favor and so the workers will reject it. There are some cases when changes are so urgent that arbitration is too long a process. Sorry, to quote again the example of the derailed train in Belgium: The strike came at once to take advantage of the publicity generated by the crash."}, {"conclusion": "As a relatively devout/ practicing Muslim, I am very concerned by the Western implementation of integration and assimilation of me and my fellow Muslims.", "id": 78478, "argument": "There are many issues on which I am either with the Democrats Liberals such as welfare or Republicans Conservatives such as the death penalty . Since the Conservatives are by default not willing to woo the Muslim vote and tend to elect or appoint openly Islamophobic people on the far right such as Steve Bannon, Marine Le Pen, and Geert Wilders , and go against other policies I am for, I cannot vote for them without having a heavy heart. Likewise, the alignment of the majority of Muslims with Liberals is beneficial in the short run ensures us some immunity of sorts. However, if Muslims like myself who go against certain liberal positions advocate for our views to be heard, there will be a significant reduction if not complete elimination of our support. Advocating for your own views to be represented in public is now heavily discouraged amongst religious groups, even though it is perfectly fine for a group having nothing to do with religion from doing so. All liberals and European Canadian conservatives will take the above view, and American conservatives will do a 180 and say that Muslims have no right to advocate those views, but Christians do. People on the right such as D.T., Steve Bannon, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, etc. and people on the left such as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Bill Maher, etc. are actively participating in an attempt to paint a picture of a clash of civilizations or philosophies between Islam and the West, or demand a reformation of Islam similar to what happened with the Protestant Reformation. Combine this with the increasing number of terrorist attacks committed by Muslims every year, and it seems at least superficially quite reasonable to propose it. Of course, what would be even better for them is if all Muslims converted moved on to either Christianity or atheism. They have the support of hundreds of millions of people, especially if you see the percentages of people who supported banning refugees from 7 Muslim majority countries here in America. They will increasingly marginalize Muslims until they change or until Muslims are dead.

Government This refers to the state executive, legislative, and judicial powers. Libertarianism seeks to restrict the potential for tyranny by limiting the powers of the state, placing those powers in the hands of individuals who in turn can pursue money unrestricted . Money this refers to corporations and any profit driven interest. Money becomes analogous with power when the amount of money being generated exceeds the cost of living for that particular individual. Libertarianism is generally guilty of completely ignoring the potential for money to become a form of tyranny. If corporations were, for example, to form monopolies over particular employment opportunities, then individuals would have less liberty to choose from many different companies. If a particular company is the only game in town, they have the right to dictate everything from an employs political beliefs, to their manner of appearance and dress, and how they conduct themselves outside of work. They are also able to pay lower wages than the employee deserves. Employees become wage slaves under a libertarian economic system and this is indeed exactly what happened during the industrial revolution until Uncle Sam began to crack down on abusive business practices . Currently, economic regulations prevent this from happening entirely and while many employers still police the personal lives of their employees the effect is mitigated substantially by the fact that employees generally have the choice to work for another company. Companies who cannot keep good employees are more likely to fail and so there is an incentive created to not behave tyrannically towards employees. People Individuals have power through numbers, social inclusion, social exclusion, and stigmatization. People in great enough numbers have massive influence on social climates which has immense bearing on an individual's personal freedoms. If you ask a member of a GSM gender sexual minority who makes their lives the most difficult and who restricts their freedom the most, they won't tell you that it's Uncle Sam. It's individual people. It's prejudiced employers who refuse to hire them, businesses who refuse to serve them because of who or what they are, and harassment in the public sphere which pushes them out of public spaces. Libertarianism fails to adequately protect minorities from abusive social climates. It fails to protect people exercising individual liberties such as drug use, for example from being pushed out of society. tl dr so in summation, despite the fact that I am a social libertarian I believe in a great deal of far left radical personal freedoms I believe that libertarianism in practice is actually potentially dangerous to liberty. I won't vote for a libertarian candidate despite agreeing with a great deal of their social ideals because I believe that their means of achieving those ideals allow tyranny to flourish. I believe that the most personal liberty is achieved when People, Money, and Government are all keeping each other in check. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

During our time at an adoption agency, we decided to look for a child that we would like to adopt. Jessica didn't care about the race of the child, while I did. Jessica wanted to adopt a South Korean Asian newborn while I wanted to adopt a South African Black light skinned newborn since I felt that it was important for me to adopt a child that is of the same race as me I am Black . Jessica and I then got into a heated argument over whether the race of the baby should matter when adopting one. Jessica argued that race and ethnicity are irrelevant and that we should just adopt a child that we would shower with unconditional love regardless of race. I then countered by saying that while I agree that everyone should be treated equally regardless of race, having a child that is of the same race as me helps me feel more confident about my identity and allows us to better pass as a family. In the dream, Jessica was white and adopting a South Korean Asian baby would make it look obvious that we adopted to outsiders. By adopting a baby that is of the same race as me, the child would better blend in . So that's the dream in a nutshell, here is an explanation of my view. I think that it is totally OK to have a racial ethnic preference in adoption because of the following reasons. I would like the child to better blend in with me. Adopting a child of a vastly different ethnicity or race can chase them to not pass and it would be obvious to outsiders that we adopted. I am allowed to have my preferences. Having racial or ethnic matchup preferences in adoption doesn't mean that I am racist. Lets start with number four. In terms of racial dating preferences, people who are against them argue that people's preferences are based off of cognitive biases which stem from a society that doesn't fully value diversity and inclusion. Some use this argument when it comes to racial adoption preferences. My issue is that while it is true that many people consider a child's race or ethnicity due to racist or xenophobic ideas, not all prospective parents make these racial adoption preferences based off of societal norms or views on race or ethnicity. Second, the reasoning behind argument one is straightforward. Parents who have biological children have a privilege or advantage over parents who adopt their children. For the former, the children will pass or blend in better than the latter scenario. For some parents, having a child that matches their race matters immensely. Third, argument two is similar to argument 1 but focuses more on how others will perceive the family based off of outside appearance. Even though society in the U.S.A. is more accepting of multicultural families, there are still some people who may feel confused or uncomfortable when they see a family where the child is a completely different race ethnicity than both parents. Even though one can argue that the adoptive parents shouldn't care what others think, being able to pass as a family unit makes things easier when said family interacts with others. Lastly, we have argument three. I think it should go without saying that as human beings, we have free will depends on if you believe in free will, but in this scenario we will assume that humans have free will . Given that prospective adoptive parents have autonomy about adoption and raising children, one can conclude that prospective parents are allowed to choose a child based off of their racial ethnic preferences. If I were to adopt a child in real life, then I wouldn't want to be pressured or shamed into adopting a child regardless of their race or ethnicity. This is a simple concept of freedom to make decisions without the fear of being shamed or judged for having a preferences. I think that is my view. I hope that my arguments made sense and if they didn't, please let me know in the comments section. Now without further adopt, please ChangeMyView . gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

So I discovered the subreddit r whowouldwin, and I found that almost all the time the general consensus is that Gandalf would beat Dumbledore in a fight. Let's take Gandalf the White against Dumbledore before he was cursed. The main points people try to use to advocate Gandalf is that he defeated the balrog, cleansed the king of Rohan, etc. They argue that Gandalf is essentially a god, so how could he be defeatable? Here's how. Gandalf's powers are limited. He is a god, and in his realm would be all powerful, but in his human body his strength is limited. His magic is powerful against people of his own kind such as the Naz'Ghul, which I think are basically extensions of Sauron's power, who is the same species as Gandalf , and things to do with fire. Fire is Gandalf's special magic affinity, and so this gives him some leverage against the Balrog, who is the essence of fire. However, we see many times where his power is limited. For instance, in the battle of Gondor, he slew orcs with a blade. Why did he do that? Because the lethality of his magic against things that aren't as I described is negligible. In the Hobbit, he was almost slaughtered by a group of orcs he was Grey, granted only to be saved by eagles. Dumbledore, on the other hand, is by no means weak, and could be lethal against any foe he meets. The only opponent he could not outright defeat as far as we know is Voldemort, who is the strongest dark wizard we know of. He has an array of magic at his disposal, not just fire type magic. He has an unblockable death curse at his disposal if necessary. We don't know how magic works in both worlds if they mixed, so we can only guess. Gandalf could kick Dumbledore's ass if he was allowed to use his full powers, but in Human form I don't think he just compares to Dumbledore. Anyways, a lot of this is speculation, and I may be talking out of my ass.

On the other hand, if the ballerina was short, a light weight around 90 110lbs wouldn't be as dangerous because it more or less fits the agreed adequate weights for their height. The problem lies with taller women and men trying to fit in an activity they have no business being involved in. Much like a short man or woman complaining that people in basketball are just too tall, or bigger jockeys complaining the business is biased towards lighter riders. It just makes sense for the activity having such light individuals, which means it's not for everyone. We accept as much for some other activities especially those where the plus is privileged, like basketball , but unfairly not for activities where the large individuals are at a disadvantage like ballet, or jockeying .

If an adult wants to use anabolic steroids for aesthetic performance reasons, that should be their decision. Furthermore, a large portion of the the kind of people who want to use steroids use steroids regardless of their legality. From a health perspective, is it not the better practical option to allow these people to buy pharmaceutical grade steroids? Does it make much sense to criminalize them? Anticipating a few arguments here, I'd like to preemptively address them with my position 1 Anabolic steroids give users an unfair advantage in sports over non users Sure, but I'm not arguing that private athletic associations like the NFL or NBA shouldn't be allowed to prohibit performance enhancing drug use by players as a condition of employment. Just that state and federal governments shouldn't prohibit people from possessing or using them. 2 Steroids have harmful side effects This is largely overblown. Yes, effects like liver damage particularly with orals and cardiomegaly are possible consequences of steroid use. But at the dosages that most bodybuilders use ~500mg test ethanate week during cycle , assuming that they are otherwise healthy, it's uncommon to experience negative effects. Also, again, it should be their risk to take. If looking good is worth risking shaving a couple years off their life to a person, why the hell not? We allow people to risk their health often considerably greater risks than anabolic steroids see alcohol, tobacco, morbid obesity on all sorts of things in the US. 3 Allowing steroids will result in a steroid use epidemic No, probably not. We can reasonably surmise this from looking at countries where steroids can be purchased over the counter and observing that in those countries, no such epidemic exists. The reality is that even if steroids were legal, only a relatively small portion of the population athletes, bodybuilders, fitness models are interested in using them.

I grew up listening to rap groups like Run DMC, Black Star, Jurassic 5, Common, Outkast, and Nas. From about 2001 2012 I used to bboy breakdance . I consider graffiti to be true art and I often compliment the pieces I come across on the street although I still recognize it as vandalism . I used to dream of becoming a Hip Hop DJ my idols were the Invisibl Skratch Piklz especially DJ Qbert, who I considered to be the Eddie Van Halen of scratch. I'm not much into the Hip Hop scene anymore being primarily a fan of rock and heavy metal , but it's definitely still a part of who I am, to some extent. So why the contention that rap is bad for the youth? For me, it isn't so much that the music is necessarily bad. Some rap groups, like Little Brother, are absolutely Grade A musicians who really know how to write and dish out creative, meaningful lyrics. Although as you will see I think that good rap artists are few and far between, what truly bothers me about rap music is the effect it has on people. There are many different ways that this negative effect can be seen. For example Pretentious fans . I'm the type of person who, nearly above all else, values realness. A person who is honest with who he or she is. Not exaggerating, not boasting, not lying to themselves. You can love a genre of music all you want, but why does that have to somehow affect your actions in such a dubious manner that it's almost laughable? I'm not denying that love for something affects our behavior. My love for theistic skepticism has encouraged me to learn more about science, philosophy, and how to question everything with a more scientifically literate perspective. But what does Hip Hop seem to encourage? Sagging jeans, weird ways of holding guns, the misuse of guns for that matter, strange hand gestures when speaking, drug use, objectifying women, weird ways of spending money, a discouragement of attaining knowledge, and confrontational attitudes. Oh, and occasionally creative writing. But OP, you might say, that's not REAL Hip Hop, that's that fake commercial crap that is negatively influencing the youth To some extent, you are correct. But would the above attitudes even exist if Hip Hop didn't exist? Bear with me there does the good outweigh the bad? That's really the number one point I'm trying to make. Yes, there are positive aspects to the Hip Hop culture. Some of which I was a part of for a great period of time in the past. But these positive aspects are far outweighed, in my opinion, by the negative influence it has had since the days of gangsta rap to the modern age of commercial rap. Gangsta rap turned an entire generation sour by promoting violence, crime, sexism, egotism, confrontationalism if that's a word , and glorification of poverty. Please note that I used to live in poverty, so don't think I deny the fact that some rappers preach about rising from that status. Nonetheless, many popular rappers seem to take their ghetto status as a badge of honor. Well, congratulations. You made kids in the 90's think it's cool to be broke. Good job earning that paycheck. Modern commercial rap encourages lousy music. That's all that really needs to be said, but I'll continue. I am a fan of many genres of music. Everything from classical, to folk, jazz, blues, rock, country, electronic music, metal, pop, underground rap, reggae, funk, etc. etc. The only genre that seems to have the LEAST amount of talent consistently is commercial rap. Why is that? Well I dunno, but whatever the reason, it probably has something to do with money. Commercial rap encourages lousy musicianship because that's what apparently sells. My last point is that there should be something to replace rap music. What is that? JAZZ. Jazz has everything that rap music doesn't, on a consistent basis. It has talent, it has a positive subculture, it values realness, it values intellect, it values improvisation, it actually sounds good, and it's not going to corrupt the youth any time soon. Bear with me as I take a moment to speak to the black culture in America this is for you, sis Jazz music is American music. It was invented at a time when racial tensions were extremely high. When black jazz musicians began to showcase their talents to white audiences, there was a sudden surge of appreciation for African American musicians. Jazz is beautiful. It has a wonderful history, that of which you are very much responsible for and a part of, and you decided to flush that down the drain in favor of a genre that is absolutely terrible in comparison. Rap has its shining moments, yes, but it will NEVER stand on the same level as jazz. You will never hear people referring to Jay Z or Eminem as classical pieces of music 100 years from now. You will certainly hear that about rock artists Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd , and jazz Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington . Here's where I get a little critical Rap is inherently sub par music, with occasional flourishes of greatness. It encourages sub par musicianship. It's time for us to stop loving this genre so much and embrace genres that actually have a positive influence especially on our youth. Do you want your kids to start a jazz band, learn an instrument, and jam in the garage? Or do you want your kids to start rapping, freestyle battling with kids at school, and bragging about how much swag they have? If you think I'm wrong, CHANGE MY VIEW . Thanks for reading my piece, and I hope I didn't offend. I genuinely believe this, as a long time, disillusioned fan of the genre. In any case, fire away your responses"}, {"conclusion": "All sacred cows must die.", "id": 39436, "argument": "I mean this metaphorically rather than literally nothing against actual cows . Our world contains thousands of diverse cultures, political mindsets, and religious practices, each with their own set of hot button issues that a culturally sensitive outsider would never dare to tread upon. However, in a world of globalization, linguistic homogenization, and international immigration, the number of different cultural assumptions to which an urbane person must be sensitive, in order to avoid offending anyone, has increased beyond the capacity of the human mind to hold them. As an aside, let's examine what it means to be offended. When an insult intentional or not is directed at our god, our political party, our group identity, etc., we feel as though we've been personally insulted. This is analogous to when we imaginarily hurt in sympathy when we watch a friend or loved experience some pain or humiliation. In short, being offended is nothing more than empathy for an abstract concept that is, for a non entity that cannot feel anything to begin with. At the same time as the world is becoming more and more connected, making offense more easy to give, the consequences of offending are becoming greater and greater. Showing the Muslim Prophet's face on film or TV could cause thousands of deaths as muslims riot in the developing world. Terrorist attacks to avenge slights against religions or national identities can now claim hundreds of lives at a time as bombing trains and hijacking airplanes become easier and deadlier. We must put an end to being offended but how? It's notable that there is an intellectual technology that makes one extremely resistant to being offended.

I want to focus on the quote below because I feel like it sums up a lot about my argument gt The question raised by his imminent release is whether Worboys may have deceived the Parole Board into concluding that he no longer posed a threat to women. It's important to note that John Worboys has served the minimum sentence and has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation which has granted him parole. However the above quote, and much of the writing surrounding this case, seems to suggest that he is incapable of rehabilitation which I infer to be due to the nature of his crimes . I think this is saying something about how our society thinks of our most outcast members such as rapists and murderers. You can see a similar trend among comment sections on Facebook and news websites in response to paedophiles, as if to suggest that they too are incapable of integrating into society and are beyond reproach. Isn't this a reflection of Britain's attitude toward criminal rehabilitation? It seems to me like we don't believe it's possible for a man who has committed these crimes to be rehabilitated. I use John Worboys in this example because it's relevant and recent but I'd be open to hearing any counter arguments that use a similar example. I'm trying to illustrate a common thread between public reactions to monstrous crimes so I'm hoping you can provide evidence where society has accepted the rehabilitation of someone following a criminal act of this severity. Unless you feel it's pertinent to your counter argument, I don't wish to discuss whether his sentence was too light, nor do I feel it's relevant to my argument that the Parole board failed to notify his victims of his release further contributing reasons for the media storm around this man . This is a different matter altogether in my opinion but I would like to mention in closing that I believe the victims were let down by not being notified and it seems to me the sentence was too light. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

This blows the system wide open for large businesses to buy off politicians. 4 The voting system and general layout of government was designed before it was possible to quickly communicate long distances, so it ignores the possibility of citizens directly participating. 5 Mass media cannot be trusted to provide accurate information and analysis to the electorate, therefore the electorate is not currently equipped to ensure a representative democracy is acting in the best interest of it's constituents. So, what would I change? So, next I'll give an idea how elections and legislation might happen by no means do I think this is a perfect or best option, just a lot better than the current one President would be elected by nationwide instant runoff voting, or some variant thereof. No electoral college, primaries, or caucuses required. The legislature would be replaced by an advisory, say 500 seats elected from a single pool by some variant of instant runoff voting. For example, Each citizen lists a number of preferred advisors, and for the first seat you take whichever candidate is listed at 1 on the most ballots, and those ballots that listed the candidate 1 are devalued to number of 1 votes for this candidate 1 500 of the total number of ballots number of 1 votes for this candidate of a vote, and the candidate that got in is removed from the rest of the ballots. Continue similarly until no candidate has more votes than the total remaining votes remaining number of seats, at which point you eliminate the least preferred candidate and continue. This way you aren't punished for voting for unpopular candidates, and if your first candidate gets in by an overwhelming majority, the proportion of your vote that wasn't needed to elect that candidate instead goes to your second favorite candidate. What is an advisor anyway? Well, these 500 people are responsible for reading potential legislation and analyzing the consequences of it. They'll also select a handful of people to participate in a pre vote debate for each bill that makes it to a vote. Those 500 people could select anyone to participate in the debate, including people that aren't politicians, or even citizens. The only requirement is that the people debating must have read the bill under debate. The debate serves to educate the electorate enough to make an informed decision about whether or not the bill is in their best interest. Who votes on a bill? Every citizen that wants to, via the internet. How could this ever be secure? When registering to vote, each voter would receive a USB keychain that contains a highly vetted bootable OS likely some linux variant, for compatibility and security , a private encryption key, and a fingerprint scanner. If the keychain is lost, the corresponding public key is deauthorized and the citizen is issued a new key pair and keychain. It would likely cost a few billion dollars to set everything up securely. One necessary tradeoff would be transparency, everyone except maybe your employers should be able to see every vote and who cast it, so voter fraud would be immediately detectable everyone can tally the public record of a vote, every citizen can check the public record to see that it matches the vote actually made, and everyone can check whether dead or nonexistent people are voting. At worst, this system would still be more secure than the crap we've been using. What about people without access to the internet? There is free internet access in many places, and no shortage of special interest groups willing to help people vote. When you look at voter turnout rates right now, it's hard to argue internet based voting would be less accessible. Who writes bills, and who decides whether a bill makes it to a vote? Anyone can write a bill, and deciding which make it to a vote would be based on a petition revision system. with commentary by citizens and advisors. Who moderates the discussion during the petition revision process? Self censorship only. You may squelch people, use filtering, and decide what to type, but other than that you'll just have to put up with people with different opinions, even if you think they're rude or inappropriate. There may need to be some rate limiting to limit spam. These discussions would require the same identifications as voting. How is it decided which bills make it to a vote? Depends on how quickly a bill can be read and debated. Likely whenever a bill is either passed or killed by a final vote, whichever bill has the most petition signatures is added to the queue. Each bill that makes it onto the schedule would first be read by the advisory, debated publicly for at least an hour there needs to be the opportunity to extend discussion , given an opportunity for revision, debated for another 1 hour to explore whether the revisions are good , and finally put to a vote. The vote for each bill would be open for one week, giving everyone interested time to watch the debates and cast their vote. Budgets may be an exception, in that they'd be submitted by the president or advisory without going through the petition process, though they'd still be subject to approval, and possibly line item veto. Local governments would take over the responsibility of providing geographic representation of it's citizens to the state and federal governments, and would need to be granted the power necessary to do so, perhaps by gaining the power to stop work done by federal or state employees or contractors within it's jurisdiction. tl dr There are problems with how the US government works, and we can do better with direct participation."}, {"conclusion": "We should help the Syrian refugees by housing them in neighboring countries", "id": 11584, "argument": "This applies mainly to the US, but is to some extent a global phenomena. The fast food industry pays the vast majority of it's employees minimum wage, which in the US is not enough for a family to live comfortably. That results in workers taking multiple jobs, leaving the kids at home unsupervised, and still needing food stamps and medicaid to help make ends meet. This is not only bad for individuals, families and, by extension, our social fabric, it is effectively the government subsidizing fast food profits, which evidence from countries with higher minimum wages shows can be made even when employees are paid more. For more information, see this recent post on The Atlantic I believe that if you have a full time job, even if its just flipping burgers , you should be able to have a reasonable standard of living and not need government support just to make ends meet.  Edit Thanks for the debate everyone Many great points made, some expected, some not. I'm still not convinced, but it has given me a better grasp of the reasons that are out there. I need to go now, but feel free to carry on Edit 2 Thanks u the icebear I can definitely agree that comfortably shouldn't be the right metric for this. It's very wishy washy. However, as far as I am concerned the point about higher wages to the point where government support in the form of food stamps medicaid is no longer needed for these workers still stands. Most replies have focused on demand and supply so far, and haven't really addressed the issue that I see, which is that the only way the wages are possible is because the government is effectively subsidizing the industry. Edit 3 A lot of folks here seem to automatically assume that I would like to raise minimum wages, so I feel compelled to add here that this is not so. I think raising the minimum wage would be an option or at least bringing it back in line with where it was in the 1970s, and allowing it to rise with inflation automatically, for example , but I don't think that it is necessarily the right approach. I've laid out more details in the comments.

If I am to get a 50 steak at the local trendy restaurant or steak house, I am to tip over 10? I understand that generally at a more expensive restaurant I will spend more time there making the servers work a longer time on my needs. And they are usually expected to be more knowledgeable about the menu. And the bus has to make thing look better and the bartender has to know more cocktails But it seems to me, the tipping tradition has propped up a non egalitarian system where the young and attractive can rake in a decent pay check because expensive restaurants can be exclusive about hiring, and others, especially the older who probably did not really want to be stuck server their whole career, are left taking the 15 on my cheap dinner. If I go in simply for a beer and a dessert, I try to tip above 50 . For affordable dinners I try to tip 25 30 . For nicer dinners I usually end up tip 15 20 . Truly bad service and I will only tip 10 15 . And if they have a truly helpful suggestion at that trendy restaurant I may tip over 20 I think we should move to a system based more on how long you are in the restaurant, and the amount of attention your visit actually needed, rather than a simple percentage completely isolated from the nuance of the service.

Commentary is overwhelmingly supportive of the mother, holding her up as an example of the kind of parent that kids these days need. The only admirable thing about the mother is that she went down to the riots and took responsibility for her child. When I watch the video, I see a mother that has lost control of her anger and takes it out on her son. The son isn't being taught why his behavior was wrong he's being taught the consequences of an angry mother. The great irony of those who support this mother is the fact that she had to go collect her son while he was rioting. The examples of good parents are the ones who's children were not rioting, destroying property, looting, or hurting others. The ultimate purpose of beating and spanking is to discourage a behavior through the use of fear and pain. A secondary purpose is an outlet for the anger of a parent if you disagree, think about if parents are usually calm or upset while doling out this type of punishment. This teaches the lesson that you influence the behavior of others using fear and pain. It also teaches them that physically hurting others is what you do when you are angry with them. I fail to see how this strategy would teach anybody to solve problems without violence. I would not consider the angry mother to be a bad parent, but her actions should not be heralded as if she were a model parent. The type of parenting that keeps kids out of riots is one where you are involved with your children, provide structure, are consistent, and teach them right from wrong. You can't mold a mind by hitting a head."}, {"conclusion": "The economic policies espoused by Paul Krugman and others are evil.", "id": 24194, "argument": "The specific issue I have with Krugman was discussed in a NYT op ed today, titled Time to Borrow In it, Krugman discusses the fact that, since the U.S. government can borrow long term 10 years at .09 and 30 years at .64 , according to the article , we can and should significantly increase our debt spending on infrastructure etc beyond the ~ 20 trillion we already have in debt and the half a trillion we will accrue in 2016 alone. He makes a number of arguments for this, including the low interest rates, the need for infrastructure spending which he calls investment , and that we don't have too much debt . This is, at best, an opinion. We currently spend 6 of our budget, or 223 billion per year, just to service the interest on our debt source That is interest accrued by previous generations congresses. It is also federal revenue that can not be spent by the government for infrastructure social services tax breaks etc. For the sake of simplicity and specificity, let's try to ignore the arguments for and against the value of the spending itself that can be a  for another time . Instead, I'd like someone to explain to me how it is not wrong evil to spend money that children who have no say or vote in spending will have to pay back at some point. Even worse and this is where I think evil really comes into play , people not yet born will be on the hook for this spending, even though some or most of the benefits will be used up before they are able to enjoy them roads bridges will require upgrading by the time they are adults . If people want public services, infrastructure, etc. they should pay for it themselves, either through higher taxes or lower spending in other parts of the government. The reason why debt is popular among politicians is because it allows them to appeal to the largest number of constituents stuff for everyone , at the expense of those who cannot vote, or aren't even yet born. Even with low interest rates, future generations will be forced to have a lower standard of living as they, at the very least, service the interest on the debt. Presumably, at some point people might want to actually pay back the debt, which would mean a further reduction in standard of living, as money goes towards interest and principal payments for benefits they barely got to use if at all , instead of whatever programs future generations might want to invest in. Even with Keynesian multipliers which I would dispute as well , you are still getting stuff you want now, at the expense of the unborn, while gambling that the multiplier economic growth etc. will make up for it. This argument does not change my view. To me, programs implemented outside of a crisis e.g. we are attacked and at war that are specifically designed to utilize debt to finance them as opposed to programs which already exist and add to the annual deficit are evil, pure and simple. It is forcing unborn generations to labor for stuff in 25 years that we want now. ."}, {"conclusion": "If your child injures my child due to reckless behavior that went uncorrected because you, the parent or guardian, were sitting far away and not paying attention, you are responsible for any damage done, especially any serious injuries.", "id": 122093, "argument": "I've got a 2 year old daughter and we've been to all sorts of parks.

I feel no need to say I'm going to be a future Spartan or in no way see myself saying anything like that in the future. I think college nationalism can be pretty stupid sometimes, and I get that some people consider their best years of their life to occur in college, but I think it's more reasonable to say Man, I really enjoyed my college years compared to Man, I loved being a school name . It really doesn't help that my Facebook feed is flooded by people moving into their new dorms and whatnot, which has sort of fed my opinion that college nationalism is stupid. So yeah.

A lot of takes on this issue have been about fairness for those that worked their way through college, saved money, joined the military, etc. I'm not going to argue on those terms because I don't think that's a good reason to oppose this plan at all mostly, I think that making others suffer through something just because you had to is selfish . Instead, my argument is going to be from the perspective of an environmentalist. Specifically, I believe that cancelling student debt would cause an uptick in consumption and thus contribute to a growing global warming crisis, which I think should be a higher priority. Although some current estimates suggest that student loan debt doesn't cause too much of a drag on consumption 1 , I think this doesn't properly examine the effect that student loans have on consumption in the long term. The costs of higher education and the associated burden of debt has been linked to moving back home with one's parents 2 . If these borrowers were to have their loans forgiven, that may lead to an increased rate of moving out and purchasing a home. This would probably lead to an increase in new home construction, which increases one's carbon footprint 3 . Additionally, student loan debt is often cited as a reason why women are delaying having children 4 . Given that US citizens are, per capita, among the greatest contributors of CO2 emissions 5 , keeping the birth rate low in the US could be greatly beneficial in trying to curb global warming. I've been paying 600 a month for several years, so I know the exorbitant cost of tuition and the associated student loan burden is ridiculous. I've definitely had to forego opportunities and live more frugally because of this issue, but I think dealing with the climate crisis is a higher priority. It's very possible that climate change associated with global warming could threaten crop yields and contribute to societal unrest just like it did in Syria 6 . Unrest can easily lead to war, and that's something that should be avoided at all costs especially in a nuclear age . In that sense, I believe that curbing consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions is of highest priority, and relieving student loan debt conflicts with that goal. x200B 1 2 3 4 5 6"}, {"conclusion": "Religious tenets may help live in peace those who adhere to them.

I recently purchased a new bike, and as the tradition of my family goes, we welcomed the bike as a member of the family, decorating it with the symbols of 'Aum' and the Swastik Even when we purchase new homes, the swastik is scribbled as a 'good luck device'. My niece, 7 y.o., in the US faced uncomfortable questioning from teachers and schoolmates, because she had, in spite of her parents kind of warning her to remember not to, innocently scribbled the right facing swastik, which is against the Nazi left facing swastika. I feel it is the duty of an evolved society to proactively eradicate prejudice, and I don't see it happening soon with the Hindu symbol of the swastika I see the efforts which her parents had to take to avoid her acting innocently and drawing something sacred to her very demeaning, something which should not happen in a free society. My  is mainly against the lax attitude we have towards protecting the respect and eliminating stereotypes of 'foreign' cultures and religions in the west, and for the elevation of the swastika to a neutral symbol so that it doesn't create hatred. Okay guys, Delta time Guys, thanks, its been a great chat in here. Edit A few points I would like to make 1 I agree that the swastika bears significant memories w.r.t. the unimaginable horrors faced by a vast jewish population, and the world is not aloof from the consequences. My only point is that the perception of the symbol needs to be brought back slowly and non aggressively, while not forgetting the association it had with one man and his team of maniacs. I feel we owe it's 6000 year old existence, and the 1 billion human support it has for it's positivity. 2 Some people brought up things like 'Indians like Hitler' and stuff. I kindly ask you, do you not have idiots in your society? Some buffoons here feel 'honoured' that 'their symbol' was used by the most evil dude of the century. They feel proud, they simply feel proud like idiots, and have no idea of the sheer horror which lies in killing a person Historically, India has been a safe haven for many traditions, popular among them being Jews and Zoroastrians This article says more than I can say, with more personal first hand experiences. 3 Some people said that Hindus and Buddhists are not a significant population in the west, so the priorities are not overwhelming for change of the Swastika's perception. To them, I ask how long will it be before humanity exchanges human resources on a global level, considering the rate of globalization today. Won't a cultural symbol so widely and casually used in Hindu and Buddhist traditions pose a problem now that we have two extreme interpretations, both popular in their own regions of influence? I feel that the good should always over weigh the bad, and that Humanity will be a better winner if it is able to clean something dirty rather than discard something with a flawed side. gt Hello, users of  This is a footnote from your moderators.

He has since resigned in disgrace. He deserves to never work as a deputy again, however he also deserves some measure of sympathy. No one knows how they are going to react in a situation of extreme violence until they are actually engaged in it. He was more likely than not simply scared stiff for his life. While he is a trained professional and should have been able to carry out his duty, the fact that he was incapacitated by his own fear is a deeply human feature that we should all be able to relate with. His failure as a professional trained in the use of deadly force further points to the absurdity of believing that teachers, who have other primary professional duties, including teaching, nurturing and empathizing with children, should be armed with weapons to prevent gun violence in schools. When violence arises an environment is terrifying and above all chaotic. There is no reason to believe that if a trained professional can fail at his or her job in protecting children in such an environment that a non professional armed teacher would do any better. They may, of course, but we should not be counting on such non professionals to assess our children as a target for gunfire or for protecting them with their own deadly violence. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Let's just disregard the fact that average voter generally means the white voter, in this case. I think people conservatives and liberals, alike have a fundamental misunderstanding of the left's relationship with identity politics. First off, people that whine about identity politics seem to think this issue begins with the left. It starts with these communities that collectively complain about their problems. My issue with this is that this seems to be a very ahistorical view. White, Christian male identity politics are the original identity politics. It wasn't like black people, women, the LGBTQ community, etc. just started having gripes in a vacuum. These are groups of people that have historically been ostracized from society based on their identity. Blacks were enslaved based on their identity. Women weren't allowed to own their land based on their identity. Gay couples were denied the right to marry and adopt based on their identity. Thus, these groups of people of similar identity were literally forced to advocate on each others behalf due to unfair treatment by the majority. It's incredibly troublesome to me that people ignore this. So when I see people like Jordan Peterson getting mad about identity politics, I can't help but shake my head and wonder if he actually understands how these groups began thinking collectively in the first place. Because it certainly wasn't for no reason. And it isn't like the fight is over on any of these fronts. Blacks are still facing issues with police brutality. The LGBTQ community are still dealing with social backlash to their identities. Women are dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace and not finding adequate help when they want to come forward. ICE are literally asking Mexican people for their papers. All of these atrocities are rooted in the identities of these people. Why should they not band together and advocate for each other? I don't see why that's bad. So now let's focus on the right. As I said before White, Christian male identity politics is the original identity politics. How can you honestly say that the Democrats engage too much in identity politics when almost 90 of the Republican Party is white?They very much seem to be catering almost exclusively to one identity . Do you think that's just a coincidence? Of course not. They consistently denounce people that don't belong to that identity. How is that not identity politics by virtue of exclusion? All this War on Christmas and Santa Claus was white, sorry crap is White, Christian identity politics. We had Southern white people flee the Democratic Party and run to the Republicans because our president had the audacity to help give black people rights. That right wing worldview is so heavily rooted in identity, it's ridiculous. Democrats have a more diverse voter base because they picked up the slack that Republicans weren't willing to pick up. That isn't the fault of Democrats. Identity politics is not the fault of democrats. It's the fault of Republicans those demonized those identities to begin with. It's why I honestly laugh whenever I hear a Republican whine about identity politics. It's their creation. But even liberals fall for this because the default identity in the US is perceived as being a white person. You see this with dumb, but well meaning liberals that say the left needs to stop focusing on identity politics and start focusing on the working class because it's better for winning elections. First off, the implication here is that, somehow, the LGBTQ community, black people, Hispanic people. Muslims, etc. can't be working class. That's incredibly problematic. Secondly, they say this because they feel that advocating for these groups is off putting to white voters. So the left needs to abandon marginalized communities because advocating for them makes white people uncomfortable? White people always need to be the center and the focus of the discussion? Again, that's a form of identity politics on behalf of white people that never gets acknowledged as such. I'm open to all discussion. If I need to be more clear in a certain area, please let me know.

However, just recently I started using machines. I noticed that not only do I enjoy using machines more, but I also can get much more done in a shorter amount of time. Let me give you a scenario Say I want to train my full body using nothing but a barbell. Well, I could choose to do bench presses, rows, and squats. Now I have to worry about loading and unloading the weights, and giving my body an adequate rest time in between sets. It is much more difficult to do drop sets, as bench presses will work a large number of different muscles at once. The caveat here, however, is that while I am working secondary muscles, I am not pushing them to their maximum potential. So given the bench press example, lets say I choose to use machines instead. Well, in the same time frame and using nearly the same amount of exertion, I can use the chest press machine and then immediately use the pec fly machine afterwards. The time required for resting between these two machines is virtually non existent. Also, since I am isolating the muscles better, I am pushing these muscles in a manner which utilizes them to their maximum potential, causing the greatest amount of muscle fatigue possible. Not only do I save time, but I can get more work out of the specified muscles I want to train. The most common argument I hear when people talk about free weights vs. machines is that machines don't work stabilizer muscles . I've read this over and over with no actual science to back it up. It is parroted in nearly every single debate on the matter. So I asked myself what the hell is a stabilizer muscle, anyways? I learned that these stabilizer muscles people are talking about are nothing more than the secondary muscles which are worked when doing compound movements. That's right, so if you were to use free weights you would be utilizing these secondary muscles, but you wouldn't even be utilizing them to their maximum potential. So if we were to once again refer to our bench press example, we could say, in the simplest of terms, that the bench press works your pecs and then your triceps as a secondary stabilizer . Now we could do bench presses with a barbell and get work out of both of these muscle groups, however, the amount of fatigue our bodies undergo are vastly different when compared to doing a chest press and tricep extension on machines. Not only that, but we would require zero resting time in between the chest press and the tricep extensions, essentially allowing us to go from one exercise to the other instantaneously. I should also mention that this concept that machines don't work secondary muscles is simply absurd. Finally, I want to address the element of gravity. With dumbbell chest flies, you are only pushing your pectorals to maximum usage in about half of the movement. This is because at the top and bottom of the movement, gravity removes all resistance from the desired muscle target. Whereas if we looked at something like the pec fly machine, we can see that gravity no longer becomes a factor for allowing our muscles to rest during work. This is because there is a constant tension on the target muscle in 100 of the movement. Given this information, I have come to the conclusion that free weights are in no way, shape, or form superior to machines for muscle development. . gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

I agree that this is within their right to do so, but not questioning why they do so can lead to abuse. In 2017, Israel pressed Facebook to delete accounts of Palestinians that Israeli security agencies deemed to be incitement. If Facebook didn't comply, they would be fined or outright banned in Israel. Facebook eventually complied with the demands of Israel. You'd imagine that these accounts are being removed because they call for genocide of Israelis or something of that nature, but many are pretty innocuous. One account was removed simply \u201cbecause of an old photo posted of former leader Yasser Arafat holding a rifle\u201d by a user.

The reason for their murders were due to cartoons they published satirizing the prophet Muhammed. Whilst the majority of people I've seen have been firmly in Charlie Hebdo's camp, there seems to be a noticeable backlash against Charlie Hebdo and some of the things they've done to the extent that people have protested against PEN's a freedom of speech organisation decision to award them honours. I want to address some of these claims. A Guardian article recently had this to say about CH gt The narrative of the Charlie Hebdo murders \u2013 white Europeans killed in their offices by Muslim extremists \u2013 is one that feeds neatly into the cultural prejudices that have allowed our government to make so many disastrous mistakes in the Middle East First issue this is a complete dehumanization of the staff who lost their lives that day. Suddenly, a murder becomes a narrative that way, we don't have to see it as a crime. Furthermore, I imagine that Mustapha Ourad, copy editor of Charlie Hebdo, would be surprised to hear that he is white if he were alive to hear it . There are these claims that the writers at CH are racists a claim that is demonstrably wrong, as I shall go on to explain , who oppress 'marginalized' peoples with cartoons. I suppose the people who make these claims either simply ignore, or do not see, the fact that the people who killed the cartoonists are very, very, very obviously racists themselves demonstrated by their targeting of a Jewish community following the attack on CH making them authentic, evidently racist killers. No one mentions that part of the 'narrative', do they? The claim that CH is racist is an absurd one. I'll demonstrate why. Take this image from the New Yorker Say you knew nothing of The New Yorker or wider US culture. What do you think this image conveys? That the New Yorker thinks Obama is a terrorist that would be the only logical conclusion you could deduce. The real purpose of that image is to parody the extreme right wingers of US politics and their claims about Obama tea party claims that he is a terrorist, muslim, and unable to stand for presidency. To understand this, you require an understanding of current US political culture. Now, take this widely circulated cover of CH's apparent racism It shows Boko Haram sex slaves shouting 'Don't touch our welfare'. Now, imagine you have no understanding of Frances wider political culture of CH. What do you think this image conveys? That CH is a racist, right wing magazine. Now, if you did happen to possess an understanding of Charlie Hebdo and France's wider political culture you'd immediately understand that the image is doing something extremely similar to the one on the New Yorker. It's parodying the extreme paranoia of the right wing, anti immigration parties that began to arise in France by displaying enslaved, pregnant, Boko Haram sex slaves invading France and taking their money. Anyone with any understanding of French culture and CH know for a fact that CH is a left wing magazine that has routinely expressed their desire for immigrants to remain in their country, and that the rights of immigrants be respected. Ignorant people with no prior knowledge of parisian culture, of the history of CH, make these absurd, disgusting, disrespectful claims about CH. gt 'attacking marginalized peoples' muslims Firstly, if attacking 'marginalized peoples' is such a major issue then their would be zero criticism, parody, or satire from the left aimed at the working class peoples who voted for the Tea Party, Ukip, of the French NF. Is that the case? If Tea Partiers, or the French NF, had gunned down CH would their be claims that CH's vicious attacks on their ideology lay hold to the blame of the attacks? Would that argument be defended? The people who argue this way must therefore agree that there is an Islamic blasphemy law that is enforced at gunpoint regardless of whether a population wants it and that you are to blame if you are slaughtered for saying something other people don't like. Charlie Hebdo was a beacon of light, a welcome friend, and an invaluable ally to moderate and liberal Muslims across the globe. gt Islam Islam has no special place. It should receive the same level of parody, criticism, satire, and insults that every other religion and ideology has if not more so given it's followers reluctance to accept this. It's followers have no right to demand people not to write this way. Muslims have zero right to murder those who don't believe the same things as they do, or insult the things they believe. Muslims who support those who commit these murders are equally as disgusting and retched as those who commit them. gt but you shouldn't hurt peoples feelings You also shouldn't kill people. This is not an argument I take seriously Islam needs criticism, parody, and satire, and muslims need to see it, in order to understand that in Western Countries, this is an important aspect of our culture. Islam is not above reproach, it is not above satire. The reason for the killings given doesn't even make sense anyway Islam restricts muslims from drawing Muhammed. Non muslims can draw whatever they want. I understand there are people who do not agree with CH.

If the landlord finds this service helpful they should pay this fee, not me. There's a few side effects of this stupid broker's fee. One is that it reduces the amount of rent I can pay initially. It also affects how much new furniture I can afford. It also makes it prohibitive for me to move since I need a large sum of cash saved up before every move. This allows the owner to start jacking up the rent after the lease expires even when market prices have remained stagnant. This almost always happens. This year my rent went up 75 even though there have been no improvements to the property and from what I can tell rent prices elsewhere seem to have remained relatively constant. I haven't ever purchased real estate so I'm not sure if their service is more valuable for those types of transactions although I'm inclined to believe it's not really necessary for that either. In general it seems to me that real estate brokers are an obsolete job. Sort of like travel agents. The internet has eliminated the need for this job since both tenants and landlords can post and browse the available inventory and initiate the transaction from there. They should not be leeching off me every time I move and I think the money they are extracting for a useless service is excessive and harms the economy overall."}, {"conclusion": "I don't think we the human race can ever be equal.", "id": 13080, "argument": "The US ambassador pointed to the sacrifices for victory instead of power coming from the nuclear bomb as justification for post war influence."}, {"conclusion": "There has been a shift in the anti-war stance of US citizens since 9/11.

But I have become increasingly dismayed with what I see as their opposition to free speech keeping in mind that it is an extremely heterogeneous coalition . In brief, I believe they are intentionally conflating Trump supporters with the alt right, and the alt right with neo Nazis for political advantage. In the last two weeks, I have been called a Nazi sympathizer twice by confirmed liberals , simply because I believe any group should be able to air their views in an appropriate public place without fear of retribution, assuming they do so without violence. Three specific instances I think have not met this standard are 1 The reaction to the James Damore Google memo , where employees were asked for commentary about the company' diversity policy, and he responded with a well researched, but politically incorrect, rejoinder. I take no position on the contents of the memo, but I am deeply disturbed that he was fired for it. 2 The free speech rally in Boston this weekend. The organizers specifically stated they would not be providing a platform for hate speech, and yet thousands of counterprotesters showed up, and moderate violence ensued. Perhaps the most irritating thing about this is, in every media outlet I have read about this event in, free speech rally was in quotes, which seriously implies that free speech isn't a legitimate cause. 3 A domain registrar, Namecheap, delisted a Neo Nazi website called the Daily Stormer on the basis that they were inciting violence. For the non technical, a domain registrar is a relatively routine and integral part of making sure a domain name points to a particular server. I haven't visited the site, or similar sites, but I see this move as an attempt to protect Namecheap's reputation and profits, and prevent backlash, rather than a legitimate attempt to delist all sites that promote violence. I highly doubt they are delisting sites promoting troop surges in the Middle East, for instance. All of this, to me, adds up to a picture wherein the left is using social pressure ostensibly to prevent hate, but actually to simply gain political advantage by caricaturing their opponents. The view I wish changed is that this seeming opposition to free speech is opportunistic, cynical, and ultimately harmful to a democratic political system that requires alternative views. If anyone wants to counter this view with a view of people are entitled to free speech, but they are not free from the consequences of that speech , please explain why this isn't a thinly veiled threat to impose consequences on unpopular viewpoints with an ultimate goal of suppressing them.

I've thought about this for a while and I don't think any physical activity can be constituted as a sport unless they meet 3 criteria The activity must be physically demanding. There must be an objective way to award points and decide a winner. Competitors must directly oppose each other and be able to impede each others' progress. Most sports are physically demanding so they pass the first criteria. I don't think golf is a sport, because it's possible for someone to win a major championship with a torn ACL and a broken leg ergo the activity must not be that physically demanding. I don't know of any other physical activity that does not require the use of legs or ACL wheelchair sports aside . Also, there are plenty of PGA golfers that are old, overweight, or out of shape. Some claim chess is a sport based on criteria 1, this is not the case. Same goes for so called cybersports . Point 2 challenges a lot of events in the Olympics both winter and summer , but it also applies to, say, boxing when after 12 rounds and there has been no knockout, the winner is voted on by judges . Events like figure skating, ice dancing, or slopestyle are judged basically we ask a bunch of people how they thought a competitor did, and do some kind of statistical analysis like throwing out the top and bottom scores to figure out what the right score is. By definition this is subjective, and it has in the past and certainly will in the future cost a competitor a championship. See the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skate controversy or the Pacquio vs Bradley boxing match Example how the hell is ski slopestyle scored? I saw some pretty spectacular performances in the men's ski slopestyle semifinal last night, and on at least one occasion there was a close up of an athlete celebrating an awesome performance, then immediately raised his eyebrows in surprise when he got a lower score than expected. The commentators were just as surprised. Obviously referees and officials may decide games due to poor calls non calls, but the best officiated games are ones where the referees blend into the background. This is exactly the opposite of judged events where everything depends on how the judges feel. Point 3 points out the fact that in many events, you don't actually even need to compete against other people. Racing is a prime example. Take swimming. If it all comes down to who can post the best time, is there even a point to having a pool with 8 swimmers in it at the same time? Same goes for sprinting or other time based events. Competitors could take YouTube videos of themselves competing and posting their times and it would be the exact same as actually going to a meet to race. Obviously, events where the terrain matters can't be done like this marathon, ski racing, etc but it'd be entirely possible to go one at a time and figure out your score. Your competitors simply don't matter it's mostly a race against the clock. My narrow view of sports now leads me to think the following displays of skill are not sports Golf Figure Skating Swimming Track and Field X Games styled events slopestyle, half pipe, etc Gymnastics These may all be great examples of physical prowess and athletic ability, and I'm not trying to disparage these events.

I think it's incredibly useful when trying to describe a group of people who actually share a significant amount in common i.e. shared socioeconomic status, beliefs, geographic location, ideals, purpose, strong feeling of camaraderie with others in their community, etc. . As such, I'd object to someone saying The Muslim Community, but not, The Muslim Community of East side Livermore, California The former refers to almost 2 billion people, lumped together almost exclusively because they'd all check Muslim in a poll on their religion, while the latter refers to a group of people who all live in a single town, in the same area of that town, presumably of similar socioeconomic class, likely all speak the same language, etc. In other words, the latter category actually refers to people who stand a decent chance of knowing one another, or at least being connected by small degrees of separation. The former is an attempt to lump together all Muslims, many of whom live thousands of miles away from one another, speak different languages, have entirely different conceptions about what Islam means to them, and, in extreme cases, might even believe other members of their community should be killed because they're not actually members of their community, since their beliefs beliefs that, in this case, are literally the only thing being used to group them together are so different. In this regard, saying Muslims, or the global population of Muslims, is, I think, more accurate, in a way that The Muslim Community is not. Take another example. I recently heard an NPR piece on publicly available bikes in San Francisco. The bikes are apparently built for those with average builds, and the host commented paraphrasing that the Tall Community might be adverse to them. In what way is saying Tall Community better, or more accurate, than saying tall people who live in San Francisco? Community implies tall people of which I am one interact and engage with one another on the basis of our height. It implies we're meeting up in Tall Community meetings to discuss issues facing our Tall Community. It implies a certain solidarity we share with other tall people that, quite frankly, isn't there. You can tell me I'm a tall person who lives in the Bay Area, that's fine, but I reject you telling me I'm part of The Tall Community. What I'm looking for to  is someone who can point out how and why it's more useful and or accurate to say The Physics Community than physicists The Tall Community than tall people, The Hispanic Community than Hispanics.

For a long time I loved the idea of being in the military and fighting for my country I'm Canadian if it makes any difference but as I got older and my worldview started to change, it became really hard for me to respect soldiers and war and anything to do with the military. Let me explain why The idea of countries, in and of itself, is ludicrous to me. We created imaginary borders, and claimed a piece of the Earth as something that's somehow separate from others. Then when we disagree with other claimed pieces of Earth, people are sent to war with them to die over things that probably wouldn't have been an issue if the Earth didn't have countries in the first place. The military wouldn't be necessary if we all lived in one nation, and being such an idealistic person, that keeps me from being able to respect anything military related. It's murder. Soldiers are killing other human beings who have emotions and families and individual lives. It's hard for me to find any kind of justification for this. Why are the people in our country more important and more worth defending than the people in another country? There is absolutely no honor in killing another person, no matter the reason. It infuriates me when war is glorified. Thanking a soldier for their service is thanking them for committing murder. Soldiers have such a high rate of PTSD, suicide, and homelessness. Families lose loved ones. Military technology is not something humans should have access to. Nobody should have the ability to press a button and send a nuke to destroy the Earth as we know it. War is futile. The lust for revenge is never satisfied, and as long as countries have soldiers, there will be bloodshed. The military budget could be spent on much better things that would benefit people instead of killing them. I'm aware that it's very unrealistic to expect there to be some sort of global agreement for everyone to abolish their military, but where I stand right now, it's what I think would be the best thing for humanity. If minds started to change and people refused to join, eventually we could make a real difference. Is the military really necessary? Is it beneficial for humanity? What makes murder as a solider acceptable, but murder in any other context wrong? Why should soldiers be praised and awarded medals for taking lives? I'm completely open to changing my viewpoint on this, but I haven't heard any argument that I could get behind. Change my mind. EDIT I'm heading to bed now.

We can assume that no group of those with a personal ideology can create a group large enough to reach supermajority, because of the aforementioned conflict and lack of monolithic belief systems endemic to personal ideologies. Islam is on path to surpass Christianity worldwide as the value systems of the demographics of Christianity have diverged.

There's a few things that stood out to me though Kylo Ren is an awful antagonist He suffers from Bane Voice syndrome, where the film makers tried to give him some personality. I think they wanted to evoke Darth Vader, but they ended up making a weird nasal echoing voice that just didn't work at all. I wasn't afraid of it, I was just slightly confused. The big reveal when he takes off his helmet is a massive let down. We have this character that's meant to embody evil, and he is just a whiny pasty slightly ugly teenager. They basically made him into Anakin Skywalker from the prequel trilogy, and that is not a compliment. His character design makes him feel like a knock off Darth Revan. In between the films we've had some many interesting spin off stories and game characters we've had Darth Malgus who looks truly intimidating. Even Darth Maul was a really awesome character design which was criminally underused. Captain Phasma is a non character. Why is she included? What purpose does she serve? There was hype for that character, there were the sites constantly publishing the epic burn that the facebook page gave someone saying the female armour didn't look feminine enough I expected her to be more present, to feel bigger. I think they wanted her to feel like Boba Fett who was memorable despite having very little screen time but it just fell flat. She was used in I believe only 2 scenes, one of which was her being kidnapped out of the blue to turn off the shields, which killed any feeling of badass female stormtrooper I might have had. The big threat was horribly executed The big threat in the movie is meant to be this planet buster super weapon that drains a sun to fire but that just made me feel nothing. It was introduced almost randomly, and then they basically turned it into another death star battle right at the end of the film. I felt no tension, I felt no fear, I knew the rebels weren't going to be allowed to be destroyed. They have a meeting and make a huge deal out of showing this planet dwarfing the death star in size, and I just couldn't care less. You're going to make a trench run of some kind, you'll blow up a small target, the planet will implode. So predictable. They even had to take down the shield generator, so the whole final battle is basically a discount mashup of the first and second death star fights. I hate Rey's character I know what she was meant to be. She was meant to be a strong female lead to become a jedi and gender equality and all that. I love what she was meant to be. But she just, wasn't. Despite her being a very vocal and very abrasive character, constantly trying to act tough and independent, she's constantly put on the screen complaining, her chin quivering, her eyes welling up. She was angsty more than really being badass. And yet I still think she was one of the stronger characters. The finding Luke ending is one of the stupidest and worst ex machinas ever They make a whole big deal about this map that the droid is carrying Episode IV references much?? throughout the whole movie, and then at the end R2D2 turns on because of course he does , shows a map, and then BB 8 slots in the missing piece. I literally groaned out loud when this happened. They made this huge fuss that their star maps were incomplete, this fragment of a map wouldn't do, they couldn't find Luke, and then that's the ending?? It felt like a video game. I half expected to hear the Zelda achievement sound when they slotted in the single map piece into the obvious hole. You're telling me no one noticed the massive hole in your star maps? No one ever bothered to go on a cartography mission in that sector of space? You couldn't work out the region of space based on local star formations? You needed to put the map chunk into the obvious hole? They actually end on finding Luke in this awful clich\u00e9 walking up a mountain and staring broodingly at each other ending it felt so cheesy, so awful. They made such a big deal out of this quest for Luke and in the end they just needed R2 to wake up and slip a puzzle piece in and then walk up a path in what appears to be European countryside wow just wow The entire film was riding on nostalgia and references, it felt like it had no real personality of its own. There were moments of forced humour that ruined otherwise tense scenes. There were terrible clich\u00e9s. There were super predictable moments it was just disappointing. There were moments I found funny, there were moments I enjoyed I actually kinda liked how BB 8 gave the thumbs up, it was cute. , but overall the film lacks any original personality, and none of the awe of the originals it was clearly aiming to be. I think the best I can say about the film is that the visual effects and the cinematography was well done. I can appreciate the work that went into the film as a filmmaker myself, but from the story perspective I came away with a bad taste in my mouth."}, {"conclusion": "The government of Albania are putting a lot of effort into ensuring stability.", "id": 71865, "argument": "There have been many large political reforms in the country to do this and, as a result, Albania would be a good candidate for NATO membership."}, {"conclusion": "Modern technology can be used to make democracy work fully as intended -- we now have the tools to address weaknesses of the past.", "id": 86401, "argument": "If we accept that we are all monitored then the reverse should also be accepted - we should all be listened to.

However, some instances of highly publicized racism that have occurred over the last month had me begging the question what rights do openly racist individuals have? When Chelsea football fans were seen acting in a racist fashion the team vowed to ban those who were responsible from attending games. When students are seen chanting racist slogans they are expelled from a state funded university. How far is this legally and ethically allowed to go? Chelsea is a private organization and they have the right to ban those who bring a negative image to the team, but if someone wrote hateful literature about a certain group should they not be allowed to attend football matches? If someone espouses unpopular and despicable ideologies do they forfeit their right to go to games, or see a movie, or go to a cafe? The question of University of Oklahoma is more interesting. UO is a state university and as such is funded by tax payer money. There are unfortunately bound to be racists in Oklahoma and they pay taxes. If the concept of a university is to promote self guided thinking and a few ignorant individuals come to a repulsive conclusion do they no longer have the right to go to that university? If someone is an ardent hater of all things not white and protestant do they no longer have the right to go to a university that they pay for? I know the stories are far more complicated than that. Chelsea fans were seen using physical violence and intimidation and UO belonged to a frat and were acting in a vocally abusive manner. However, the instances themselves beg the question of what rights to racists honestly have? Should we not treat them on par with other radicals that have unpopular opinions? Just because we by and large hate what they have to say does that mean that they cannot say it without facing punishment that bars them from functioning in our world? I do not promote in any way, shape, or form what these people believe. However, I think racists should not be stripped of their rights or perhaps even privileges simply because we disagree with them. We should let them say what they believe and then retort with our own right to free speech, letting them know we stand with those they condemn. Racism is vile, but we should not seek to ban and expel all that is vile from our community simply because we find it wrong. Side Note I understand that the notion of being able to say anything no matter how unpopular it is is somewhat of an American mentality and that in many nations such hateful speech is not protected and I am not suggesting that hate speech such as that which promotes violence should be protected anywhere ."}, {"conclusion": "I'm not sold on the progressive push in the democratic party.", "id": 79859, "argument": "Ideologically, I lean left on most issues, and vote democratic if I vote for a major party in an election. However, I believe the current progressive push going on within the party pushes me farther away from being a democratic voter consistently rather than pulling me closer. I honestly feel that many progressive policies lack detail, or at the very least, I have been looking in the wrong place for the substance I'm looking for. In some cases I even outright disagree that their policies are superior to the mainstream democratic or third party platforms . x200B To give a few examples I am taking these from the website of Ocasio Cortez, link below x200B Medicare for all I'm not convinced that this is the best way to maximize coverage subject to costs. I also have an issue with making people pay for healthcare subject to how much money they make rather than how much healthcare they use on a basic level. I favor a system where we make insurance insurance again rather than a complex subscription service, and make pricing more transparent along with providing government run programs to take insure the uninsurable, children, and the elderly. x200B Social security I think social security is a bad deal, while they seem to favor its expansion. I believe that social security should be a tiered system, wherein workers pay much smaller percentage of their salary than they currently do for disability benefits by mandate. Above this, workers should have the option to instead deposit the remaining percentage that they currently pay into a Roth or Traditional IRA, not subject to the contribution limits currently in place. This would allow for greater liquidity and superior returns on money being set aside for retirement. However, those making above 250,000 annually should be subject to the current system on earnings above that figure basically, this expands the IRA contribution limit to 5.5k plus the percentage difference between the current SS contribution and the new lower limit for disability 250k. Those that opt not to do this can still be involved in the current system. x200B Glass Stegal I don't think we need more or less regulation, I think we need more effective regulations. Regulators are totally out of touch with what they need to do to curb systemic risk in the banking industry, and based on the way the platform is written, at the very least Ocasio Cortez seems to be out of touch with it as well. The no bank being too big to fail bit is particularly ridiculous in my opinion with the current state of interconnectivity present in the financial system. x200B Student Loan Debt cancellation Absurd in my opinion, the economic gains seem tenuous and the cost would be monumental. I am ok with increasing marginal tax rates to pay for free TUITION at 4 year public universities. x200B Federal Jobs program at 15 an hour Laughable. x200B Although I fully support the rest of the platform, I feel that in light of the above, it is in my best interest to vote third party in many elections in order to attempt to have a greater amount of choice in the political process. I am open to changing my mind if someone can convince me that the policies I support are more important than the ones I don't, and that I should therefore support progressives, or if someone convinces me that I should support a policy that I don't currently. x200B Link x200B x200B x200B x200B"}, {"conclusion": "There is an internal stigma against getting treatment for mental illness within the military.", "id": 21353, "argument": "One study found that more than a third of soldiers thought they might be denied promotions or experience other backlash if they sought mental health treatment."}, {"conclusion": "Rape victims should get one free pass to kick the shit out of the culprit, once they've been proven guilty.", "id": 113425, "argument": "Rape is a horrible thing, and should not happen to anybody unless the victim has committed a crime so sadistic and twisted they're basically inhuman and thus deserve it . First of all, here's what I believe qualifies as rape It must be forced penetration involving the genitals or a hole of one or both of the parties, or an inanimate object intended to simulate one of the above e.g. sex toy, or makeshift alternative . Physically restraining someone so that they can't resist said penetration. Banging someone that's black out drunk or under the influence of drugs if both parties are black out drunk and or drugged up and neither of them was intentionally plotting the act beforehand, then nobody should be blamed . Threatening someone to force them to submit e.g. gun to the head . Example Scenario If you're at a party one night, someone drugs you, and you wake up the following morning to find out that someone fucked you while you were under the influence, you'd feel violated, taken advantage of, and understandably pissed. I believe that should this or something like it come to pass and the guilt of the other party is proven in court, the victim should get a free pass to beat the shit out of them. I'm talking 15 minutes alone with them in a room where they are bound and gagged, completely at the mercy of their victim. Only rule is that the person administering the beating cannot kill the culprit they likely still have a prison sentence to serve . A single camera to keep things from getting out of hand, and two guards just outside the room. In the event the victim is dead or otherwise unable to carry out the beating, someone closely related to them would carry it out in their stead. This will be done regardless of the victim's or the culprit's Age Yes, even minors. If they're capable enough to rape someone, they should be capable enough to take the punishment. Gender Even in the event of a male victim and a female culprit, he should be allowed to kick the shit out of her. The main reason why rape has such a negative impact on the victim is due to the feeling of powerlessness that comes from it, so having complete power over the one responsible for their pain would serve as something of a positive experience for them. It would also give them closure, knowing that they gave as good as they got, they won't have to live the rest of their life longing for vengeance. This would also act as a deterrent for other rapists, as getting caught would be even worse for them. As previously mentioned, the beating would only be a punishment to people who are convicted of the crime, so as to prevent the innocent from being wrongfully targeted. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Resisting arrest is currently a felony offense in multiple states USA but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the 'offenses' committed by the perp. For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony against the law to resist an unlawful arrest meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you they can still arrest you, and you aren't even allowed to flinch. I think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. Now I'm not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force but there needs to be some protection for civilians 'resisting in a reasonable fashion'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. Edit gt The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested. If a cop grabs my arm and I pull away he may think in about to get aggressive and he'll tase me or tackle me or accidentally choke me to death for fear of his own safety \u2206 so the problem is deeper than policy, it's the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. My mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws, its the people and traditions. I'd still like to see more protection for civilians but allowing resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue, a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story. Edit gt Maybe in theory, but is that really a bluff you want to call when the police officer starts saying No, you can't walk away. Get back here. ? gt I don't think that's something we want either, otherwise we've just given the same dangerous latitude to civilians that we currently give to the police when we allow them to exercise deadly force if they feel threatened. \u2206 I can't remember the policy on giving out delta's but you're points were very clear. Especially when you circled back to it's a problem with individual officers, not the system while I agree that the officer is obviously the main factor I think there is a systemically induced fear on both sides which is not addressed and maybe even escalated by allowing civilians to resist."}, {"conclusion": "Men should be able to wear shorts to work, if women are allowed to wear skirts.", "id": 78656, "argument": "I believe that men should be allowed to wear shorts in any workplace that a woman is allowed to wear a skirt.

Change my view. Edit Based on the responses I would like to rephrase my argument. The conversation has evolved into one about the difference between skirts shorts, and what is considered professional attire. That wasn't the goal of my post, so I would like to rephrase. Since we can not agree that skirts shorts are comparable, let's just say the ability to expose your legs. Women have the ability to expose their legs in the workplace, and men do not.

Over the past few years, there has been this plain text document format called markdown. Markdown is a file format and markup language that defines the structure of a document much like HTML but the syntax is simpler than HTML. The benefits of this format is that the file size for the same amount of text is a fraction of the size to a .docx Word document file with the same text and formatting, it can be created or edited in virtually any plain text editor, and that since it is an open standard, user data is not locked in to closed ecosystem where a user is dependent on a specific suite of software in the future. While I do see the potential in markdown, the main problem with the format in terms of everyday document note writing is not with its capabilities but rather its popularity and prominence as a document format. Then there is the infamous de facto standard Microsoft Word format. It has been around since the late 1980s, can support a wide array of formatting options, and can be viewed and edited by others who have Word or a compatible word processor LibreOffice Writer, WordPerfect, AbiWord . The downside is that the Word document format includes the ability to execute malicious scripts called macros markdown can run potentially malicious scripts as well but the potential damage done is more limited , and lastly Word is a proprietary document format. When someone saves text data inside a Word Document, it is stuck in a quasi open standard yes, I have heard about the Microsoft Office Open XML Standard but the implementation Microsoft uses for office is different from the ECMA specification that makes it difficult to extract and share data on operating systems that do not have word installed or do not support Microsoft Office BSD and GNU Linux for instance . However, most people use the Microsoft Word format do so because they are more familiar with it than alternative formats markdown, OpenDocument, WordPerfect, HTML, PDF, etc. or that they are concerned that their recipients might not be able to view or edit the file with the correct formatting.

From a purely natural perspective I think that animals human beings included are instinctively inclined to reproduce for the survival of the species. The best way to accomplish that would be to have multiple mates. Also, from an evolutionary perspective, more mates would mean more DNA combinations and genetic possibilities. From a societal perspective I honestly am not sure why monogamy is the accepted way of life. I know in history kings would have multiple wives and certain religions are in favor of polygamy. People seem to see people who have multiple partners spouses as promiscuous. I realize there's a risk of disease pregnancy, but as long as sex is practiced safely, this is practically not a concern. I think that socially people need security and a sense of control. They want to know that their relationship isn't going anywhere, but often that turns into a sense of ownership. How can you own a person? This is 'my' husband or 'my' wife and no one else can have him her It seems possessive and an inferior way of thinking. From a family perspective I know when it comes to children, a standard 'family unit' is what's popular, but why is a one mother and one father family the best way to raise a child? Wouldn't multiple mothers or fathers be better? Isn't the saying, it takes a village? Even with societal standards, many families don't have mother father families. There's plenty of single parents or gay parents and it works well for many people. From a personal perspective I think that it's completely natural to be attracted to more than one person.

This clause prevents the president and many others from benefiting from business ties to and gifts from foreign governments, specifically worded as emoluments. Emolument means a salary, fee, or profit from employment or office, referring to any office or employment by the foreign government. Now, this wording is somewhat archaic, as the Framers could not have imagined a world where a man like Trump has seemingly endless ventures across the globe involving numerous foreign governments and government owned ventures, but I am interpreting it to include business transactions from state owned businesses, such as the Chinese government owned business that's the largest tenant of Trump tower. In my opinion, a steady stream of income like that would count as profit from employment by a foreign power. Commonly, to avoid violating this clause through accidental investment, presidents will place their assets in a blind trust. A blind trust is, as Senator Ben Cardin has said an arrangement where the official has no control over, will receive no communications about, and will have no knowledge of the identity of the specific assets held in the trust, and the trust\u2019s manager operates independently of the owner. Trump handing his assets over to his children for management which he hasn't clearly done would not satisfy this definition, especially as Trump is aware of the assets contained in his holdings many of them have his name on them. There are numerous other such conflicts, that may not quite fit the emoluments clause, but are still concerning conflicts of interest, such as building permits that he's fighting over in foreign countries. One particularly egregious incident was his daughter joining a phone call with the Japanese president while she's working out a deal with a business that is partially owned by the Japanese government. This is but a mere fraction of the potential violations, as many of Trump's ventures are obscured from the public eye. For more information on Trump's likely violations of the Emoluments Clause, see this report by the Brookings Institute, a liberal think tank. I think that these violations mean it's only a matter of time before the supreme court rules against Trump in the CREW lawsuit or another similar lawsuit.

I refer to Ulysses itself as a work and not Joyce himself because I believe him to be a very capable author. His Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man is phenomenal, and I believe a much superior work to Ulysses I'm illustrating a point, but let's not take the debate there . Perhaps, because of his style alone, it is worthy of the quantity of discussion that followed in the near century since its publishing. However, it should absolutely never have been referred to the greatest book of all time, let a alone a great book. There is a great deal of difficulty in trying to fairly gauge a work there must be a distinction between Joyce, Ulysses, and the fans it is natural for people to criticize a thing more if they do not like the followers or its position in the world. I have read it and disliked it, but the motives for its positive reception are somewhat of a mystery, so I suppose I have to equally address the fans in order to understand the positive feelings towards it. There is some good to be said about it. It has some worthy quotes, but nearly no book is without them. Every author has written at least one remarkable sentence, if all too often by accident. These are an incredible minority in the text. We could make a citation of two, but I do not want to turn this criticism itself into a novel. There is an obvious danger of citations. In a text this big, of course I and several comments will be making biased citations to prove our respective points. I will then point out that there are few citations in the book that will go against the typical form the majority, however, will bear in very similar criticisms to these passages. In the Ulysses Annotations by Gifford and Seidman, Chapter One, roughly 20 pages in my version, has 197 footnotes. One hundred ninety seven footnotes. Provided you even use these, they do little to clarify whatever is currently happening in the text. Here I'd like to address two things a more subjective, harsher criticism of Ulysses and some of its admirers and the types of comments I'd like to avoid and negate. I will be making some small exaggerations so as to better convey some of my distaste for the book. So, then. One of the reasons Ulysses has been so admired is because it caters heavily to pseudo intellectuals. There is nothing to get out of Ulysses, and the admirers of it like to pretend they have a deeper understanding of it than others one of the merits of the work is that it caters to a superiority complex. The work is comprehensible , but only to a certain point the admirers pretend it goes much further. I respect the use of steam of consciousness, but it was not enough to carry an entire novel, let alone chapter in the free reign form Joyce gave it in Ulysses vis a vis especially Portrait of an Artist, wherein it was much more effective and contained . So let's address a first group of potential comments if you are going to say that I did not get the work, go into detail over the work's merits rather than just passing along. One last word on potential comments please, for the love of fucking God, have the decency not to waste time with a shallow appeal to authority. If you're going to use an authority in your argument, cite something contributional to the discussion. Even Andres Serrano is loved by critics. Yes, Ulysses has been well received by critics I am trying to understand why. I'll offer a quick apology for the rude additions of addressing responses. I suppose I went into this detail because of the idiotic way people responded when I asked this elsewhere. My original post refuted their points, but they made them anyway. It's necessary to admit to many of the difficulties of this sort of conversation. Appraising literature, like many other art forms, is highly subjective. I'd like to make a point against myself. One question that could somewhat easily toss much of my argument aside is this Who cares if people esteem this book much higher than you do? As you said, literary appraisal is subjective. Why not just move on? The first point I would respond with is that I suppose that is just my personality I have read hundreds of classics and studied many of them pretty thoroughly. Many of the works that have been called the greatest novels are typically worthy of this praise The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, Moby Dick, although I think Dostoevsky wins out of these. Even the lesser notable contenders have some considerable merit to this claim. In Ulysses, however, I can find none of it. I would like to compare the work to many other modern artists, but I do not want to sidetrack the discussion. Tl dr Ulysses is not a great book. Joyce's style made for an interesting experiment, but it was through and through a failure. The free reign Joyce gave his use of stream of consciousness led to an erratic, poor work.

But I really would like to understand why so many people disagree. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe you guys can set me right. I believe tipping is good. Most importantly, I believe that I will be paying the same price, tipping or no. The price of food in a restaurant will not change. If tipping isn\u2019t required, food will cost more to accommodate the wages of the service. It\u2019s not a rule, but it\u2019s very common to encounter an hourly employee that is lacking in enthusiasm. I\u2019ve seen many employees doing the bare minimum to stay employed. I like that tipped service tends to be more friendly and accommodating than hourly wage service. Hourly wages for the service industry might result in lower quality service. I enjoy over tipping. It makes me feel good. Often the difference is very small compared to the cost of food, but it frequently makes a huge difference in the mood of the server. A completely normal business transaction can brighten someone\u2019s day. I would never choose not to tip. I\u2019ve worked in the service industry and grew up learning to respect the people who\u2019s job it is to keep you happy. But for the people that believe they are \u201cpaying people\u2019s wages so that their employers don\u2019t have to\u201d there\u2019s the option of being cheap. Eventually that will lead to a terrible service hiring employees willing to work for minimum wage b increase of prices to pay for better employees c the business shutting down poor money management or inability to get consumers willing to pay the price required to maintain the business. If the consumer isn\u2019t willing to pay enough to keep the business running, the business fails and the consumer doesn\u2019t get the product. Which is the same result with any business unable to maintain a high enough profit margin. In summation, there is no difference in cost, long term, between tipping and not tipping. Hourly wages encourage lower quality service. Tipping feels good to me, and to the servers receiving the tip. Don\u2019t want to tip? Fine. Pay more for the food. Thank you for reading through my viewpoint. I\u2019m excited to understand yours. Edit Alright folks, I\u2019m off.

Unlike when they were attending secondary school, their education costs money, and usually a lot of it. Participation and attendance grades exist to provide incentives for a student to come to class and speak yet the purpose of coming to class and participating is to facilitate learning. While having these incentives in place makes sense when dealing with children, it is not necessary when dealing with young adults who have the capacity to make choices about their own learning. If a student feels like they can retain the material without attending every lecture, then they shouldn't be forced to waste time coming to the superfluous classes. In addition including participation and attendance in the grade damages the assigned grades accuracy in reflecting a student's performance. If a class has participation listed as 10 of the grade, and student A gets an 80 in the class while not participating, and student B gets an 85 with participation, then student A actually scored higher on evaluative assignments tests, essays, etc yet ended with a lower grade as student B would have gotten a 75 without participation . Finally, participation is a form of grading that benefits certain personality types in each class, without regard to actual amounts of material learned. If a person is outgoing, outspoken, and extroverted, they will likely receive a better participation grade than someone who has difficulty talking in front of large groups of people, even if the extroverted person's knowledge of the material is weaker. In addition, this leads to a domination of classroom discussions by comments coming from students who simply want to boost their participation grade, and will speak up regardless of if they have something meaningful to add to the conversation. The most effective way to  would be to show me that there are benefits to having participation attendance as part of the grade that I haven't thought of, or countering any of the points that I've made regarding the negative effects."}, {"conclusion": "Religion has been key in the creation and preservation of art and culture.", "id": 48737, "argument": "Religion had a huge positive impact on the development of architecture, music and the theatre rites originated from mysteries in ancient Greece"}, {"conclusion": "Religion has been the cause of many darkest periods of humanity.", "id": 82419, "argument": "Many historians refer to the Middle Ages, the period that saw the rise of Christianity after the fall of the Roman Empire, with the critical attribution of \"Dark Ages\"."}, {"conclusion": "the use of atomic bombs against Hiroshima and Nagasaki was justified", "id": 73579, "argument": "The continuation of a conventional war would have been much costlier than an atomic attack"}, {"conclusion": "I believe that everyone can have a bit of ADHD and everyone who could benefit from ADHD meds should be able to try them", "id": 64298, "argument": "Even though ADHD is a real disorder in the sense of it being 'other than normal', I think a lot of people with ADHD are almost elitist about it.

I feel like that putting someone to death so that they could never hurt any one again guaranteed is also silly though. Currently it costs more to put someone to death than to keep them locked up in a maximum security prison.

Reducing the cost of putting someone to death would only make it so we are less sure they are guilty. Already there are an unreasonably large amount of people being put on death row when they are later proven innocent and extending this list would not help. Death penalty in the past has not been shown to be a deterrent to crimes. This might be because one does not think of the consequences if they are seriously thinking about murdering.

I know I'm going to get blasted with comments about how it's for the public good that some of these laws like DUIs exist, but instead of punishing a drunk driver for something he MIGHT do while intoxicated, change the law to say that if harm of any kind is done to another person while he's driving then it's equivalent to murder.

Rain on a wedding day would be an example of situational irony because many women plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control. Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl. The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality. The guy who is in the plane crash says well isn't this nice verbal irony . Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality situational irony . I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe. A traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess. 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife. the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality situational irony . The free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride situational irony . Meeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic but nonetheless present movie magic fantasy of falling in love. This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife. This is cosmic or situational irony. The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive. When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony. The most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck. To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations. Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event. A less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there. According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven. I disagree. Subtle irony is irony too. Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry. I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium pop music . The final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well. Her admission needs to be taken into context. It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.

I see three principal reasons for this. Prosecuting crimes is the government's job. The government has the resources to meaningfully investigate crimes, the power to compel witnesses to testify, and institutions designed to handle criminal accusations. Private prosecutions are considered an historical anachronism in free countries today. Colleges are bad at it. Related to the first point, a college does not inherently have any of the resources or institutional structure to deal with a serious felony investigation. They can't subpoena witnesses or records, they can't put people under oath, they don't have detectives or forensics labs or judges or professional prosecutors. Due Process matters. There are core due process rights that must be abided in a free country before punishing someone for an alleged crime. These include but are not limited to the right to confront and challenge one's accuser, the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to compel witnesses to testify in your defense and to compel third parties to release evidence, the right to have legal counsel, and the right to a trial by a jury of your peers. Colleges regularly flout all of these, and the proceedings much more often resemble a kangaroo court than any real justice. Using the force of law to require that universities adjudicate these claims is farcical. If a private university wants to do something like this I suppose they can. But a public university should not be able to sanction a student based on a criminal accusation without due process, and the government should not be forcing private institutions to do the same, as they currently are doing Edit for clarification This is not about whether universities should undetake some internal considerations, but about whether the existence and form of those internal proceedings should be dictated by the government as they currently are."}, {"conclusion": "A consequence of ecotourism is that it can destroy fauna and flora.", "id": 38393, "argument": "Furthermore, more damage to ecosystem in the form of deforestation occurs as a result of roads being expanded or built to create a path for tourists to get to their ecotourism sites.

These images exist on a slippery slope an advertisement featuring a sexualized woman, for example, can very easily build a pernicious narrative that objectifies women as a group and disseminate quite nasty messages about female sexuality, female agency, female desires, etc etc. However I don't think that the original sexy image necessarily connotes negative things about women Human beings can process and recognize symbols in any given piece of media in millions, if not an infinite, amount of ways.

My primary view I want addressed here, which should be seen as a cautious view stemming from general knowledge rather than a dogmatic stance, is this Although we can measure many aspects of global weather phenomena, we haven\u2019t proven and cannot prove the extent to which humans have impacted or are impacting weather on a global scale, particularly as it relates to global warming, especially not to the degree that we can argue humans are having a significant and pervasive impact on global warming. Before I present arguments defending my view, I want to clarify my definition of prove . What I mean by prove is similar to the legal definition regarding proving someone guilty there ought to be evidence beyond a reasonable doubt or at least clear and convincing evidence that global warming is both real and significantly impacted by humans. Significantly here means that humans are causing global warming to an extent that it is damaging the planet and making it gradually less sustainable of life. Although the human impact on global warming does not need to be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt , its existence should be clear beyond a reasonable doubt or at least provide clear and convincing evidence , which so many global warming proponents imply. To simply receive a delta, you do not have to convince me of global warming in this regard beyond a reasonable doubt you just need to substantively change at least one of my currently held views regarding global warming. In other words, merely proposing \u201ccosmetic\u201d changes, such as the form of my arguments, will most likely not receive a delta. Here are several arguments defending my view nbsp The Scientific Method Cannot be Properly Applied to Global Warming Because earth\u2019s weather, the system in which global warming is said to take place, is a dynamic, uncontrolled system, the scientific method cannot be properly applied to its research, since the scientific method requires, among other things, a limiting the factors that can affect an experiment and b repeating an experiment to see whether a particular result is an anomaly or a consistent effect. Due to the the limitations of current technology, we cannot do a to test hypotheses regarding global warming, because there are many factors beyond our control. Because we cannot do a , we cannot do b , since any tests we do will deal with factors that cannot be reliably repeated. As it relates to the Butterfly Effect and Chaos Theory as applied to weather, even small impacts to a dynamic system could have greater ramifications on that system as a whole however, such small impacts would be too difficult to measure to determine if those impacts actually caused or influenced the greater weather pattern. Many Data are Unreliable Temperature, by definition, is an average of kinetic energy within a given system that is, our measurements of temperature, even on a local scale such as a city , are themselves imprecise. This observation compounds with my first point not only are we unable to put controls on the system we\u2019re proposing to make conclusive arguments about i.e., the weather system , but we don\u2019t even have the proper data with which to make conclusions even if we had better control over the system though perhaps our data would themselves be better if our control was better . How, then, are we to draw conclusions about the effect of humans on weather on a global scale if our data gathered by some of the best instruments on even a local scale are imprecise? There are Historical Patterns of Global Heating and Global Cooling There are historical patterns of global heating and global cooling across the planet well before the modern era and before the current claims of humans causing global warming. History has shown that Earth goes through 20 to 40 year cycles of temperature and that natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions, would have greater potential to impact global weather than humans. Again, the primary view I want challenged is not that global warming isn\u2019t happening though I am happy to see arguments that show it is happening rather, my view is that we haven\u2019t proven and can\u2019t prove the extent to which humans have impacted or are impacting global temperature. We can merely provide guesswork for how humans might be impacting global warming. Even Local Events are not Predicted with Great Accuracy Meteorologists\u2019 accuracy in predicting local weather patterns is not even 100 a day out, not to mention weeks or months in advance. Such inaccuracy in far more simplistic local weather reporting is indicative of the lack of knowledge we have regarding the change of weather on the planet. At least some meteorological predictions exemplify this ignorance even more significantly by basing the accuracy of their prediction e.g., 25 chance of occurring, 75 chance, etc. on what has happened with similar weather patterns in the past. In other words, they don\u2019t actually have enough info to understand how the present weather pattern should behave based on observations of the present pattern rather, they look at prior patterns and try to extrapolate apparently similar data to make an educated guess. However, as I argued above, even the data we do have is imprecise, including past weather patterns, so trying to extrapolate from imprecise data is unlikely to produce accurate results, as we see with frequently incorrect weather predictions. Therefore, this is not the scientific method this is meteorological gambling, and they\u2019re placing bets on the \u201chorse\u201d that seems most likely to win based on which horse has won in the past. nbsp Therefore, in summary, we simply have hypotheses related to global warming that are currently untestable or unreliably testable due to technological limitations. Thus, dogmatically asserting human behavior as a significant and pervasive cause of global warming is unjustified and unscientific. Secondary View A secondary view that I am fully willing to have argued against here is How can people, who have such a shaky scientific foundation as this, be so dogmatic that others are unscientific because they are unwilling to accept the tenets of global warming seeing that so many scientific objections abound against global warming? It seems to me that the opposite is true proponents of global warming are themselves unscientific and presume to shield themselves from objection with a thin and pockmarked veneer of scientific reason. nbsp I just want to end by saying that I appreciate anyone who has fully read through this post and is willing to engage with me. I have tried to present my arguments strongly, but I truly am not dogmatic on any of these beliefs and am open to understanding why people believe humans are having and have had a significant impact on global warming and am willing to be convinced of such."}, {"conclusion": "The UK should dismantle all of its nuclear weapons.", "id": 84683, "argument": "Nuclear weapons are a deterrent from a past era, and are no longer relevant to Britain's current situation.

This prohibition, however, is much weaker than similar prohibitions of discrimination on grounds of sex and race. Specifically, the prohibition allows member states and employers considerable room for imposing mandatory requirement age rules. Proposal The EU should adopt more strict standards on age discrimination and prohibit mandatory age retirement rules. Core argument Age discrimination is in many ways similar to other forms of discrimination. If we were to adopt a stance toward age discrimination, which is warranted by the similarities between age discrimination and other forms of discrimination, we would abolish mandatory retirement. We rightly are very critical of other forms of discrimination. Thus, we should abolish mandatory retirement. Importance European populations are becoming older. Insofar as mandatory retirement age is age discrimination, it is a form of discrimination that will affect many more EU citizens in the future. Also, mandatory retirement age rules shrink the size of an already shrinking workforce even further. Below I respond to three objections to my proposal. The proxy challenge For many jobs age is a pretty reliable indicator of abilities. Reply Suppose gender is a pretty reliable indictor of the sort of abilities one needs, say, in special elite forces. Nevertheless, the use of a particular gender as a requirement would be discriminatory. Why is the same not the case with age? Even though decline sets in at some point in most people\u2019s lives, the peaks of some downhill people are higher than many uphill ones. The stigma challenge Unlike sexist and racist discrimination age, discrimination does not involve stigma and negative stereotypes of the discriminatees. Reply While it might be generally thought less unacceptable to stigmatize old people, e.g., as rigid, inactive, conservative, senile etc., than to stigmatize women or members of racial minorities, there is not less stigma of elderly people. The equal opportunity challenge Age discrimination is less bad than other forms of discrimination, because, setting aside unlucky people who die young, everyone will eventually become subjected to it and, thus, it is compatible with equality of opportunity. Reply Imagine we all take turns being slaves. While this is compatible with lifetime equality of opportunity, it would still be unjust. Justice comprises more than equality of opportunity. It also comprises our relating to one another as equals.

I have read pieces of the ruling as well as the dissent, and I understand that this ruling's scope is very narrow and mostly applies to religious views and freedom of expression it is not a blanket ruling that allows businesses to choose not to serve gays. However, I have been thinking about this topic a lot today, and I personally believe that private businesses should be allowed to discriminate against whomever they like. If a private business does not want to serve people of color, or Jewish people, or whomever, they shouldn't have to. The United States is based upon a free market capitalist system albeit with some restrictions, so it's not really true free market economy, but I digress , and if a business wants to turn people away and lose money simply to uphold their personal views even if they are largely unpopular views , then I think they should be allowed to do so. If the public really thinks that this is wrong, they will simply stop going to that business, and sooner or later it won't be financially sustainable and will go bankrupt. Think of it like this let's say there is a small business who refuses to serve Jewish people. Once word of this got around to the general public, people would be upset and would boycott this business. Eventually, it would lose enough money and would have two options a 'stick to your guns' and continue to forfeit money in order to uphold your personal beliefs, or b renounce your prior views and begin serving Jewish people again. The free market makes discrimination an unfavorable business model, and if people are really opposed to discrimination, they will punish the businesses that engage in it by not giving them money.

Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. Null M. Obsession with Crime and Punishment Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws.

I'm trying to gauge how representative my experience of how quantitative methods are generally viewed by traditional humanities scholars is. Basically, it seems like there is a general distaste for quantitative methods, stemming from a few sources. First, quantitative methods are aligned with capitalism, patriarchy, and are overhyped by zelous quants who are mostly men. I can understand an association between power and quantification it's very useful on many levels, so it's not surprising that those in power use it. But I don't see that as a barrier to using quantification for other goals and interests. In other words, an association between quantification and power is an accident of history, not something essential to quantification itself. Second, quantitative methods have limited applicability to humanistic goals and questions. I agree it has limits. But I feel like I encounter assertions about these limits that don't make sense. Like someone saying I don't know how to measure fear ignoring the immense amount of cognitive science on measurement and conceptualization of affect. Or, statements that quantitative methods can't be intersectional because they must treat variables like race and sexual orientation as independent which is just plain wrong. It's trivial to run two models with y f x f z and y f x, z and test which model is better. Or, legitimate limitations of a quantitative method are treated as insurmountable. Examples I've seen include peopling acting as if time series analysis doesn't exist, mixed models don't exist, or non linear models don't exist. Basically outright ignorance of how flexible modern statistical methods are leads to a fatalistic attitude towards the capabilities of quantitative methods. Likewise, quantitative researchers are believed to be less thoughtful about their methods than they really are. Basically ignoring how much scientists think deeply about underlying issues in interpreting and presenting data, and never acknowledging perspectives like this Now, I know there are plenty of dudebros who wield the word objectivity like a verbal cudgel in debates but these guys are your average internet commenter, and don't represent the depth to which my quant colleagues understand their methods.

As history demonstrated on an almost daily basis, there have been those who sought to disrupt society for various reasons. Be it greed, political motivations or just plain old criminal insanity. Beginning in the early 20th Century, criminals of all types have managed to acquire increasingly destructive pieces of hardware firearms, explosives, and even small scale WMDs on a couple of occasions with the intent on using them to cause death, destruction and overall mayhem on otherwise relatively peaceful societies. In order to keep up with these ever evolving threats to public safety and order, most police forces have sought certain military vehicles and re purposed them for use in hostage situations, active shooter bomber incidents and riot control. Thankfully, from a statistical perspective, these kinds of scenarios, while sensationalized by the media and made out to be far more terrifying and frequent than they really are quite rare in occurrence. However, as of recent, there has been a growing movement in the United States and, to a lesser extent in Europe and other areas calling for the de militarization of any and all law enforcement agencies that are equipped with usually unarmed armored Humvees and APCs also usually unarmed that are mostly reserved for SWAT teams and sometimes modified to become mobile battering rams. Now, if it were full blown MBTs Main Battle Tanks that they were getting their hands on, I would definitely be asking questions as to why the Hell law enforcement would need that kind of firepower when our National Guard's got plenty of them in case something goes down, however, some want the Humvees and APCs gone. I believe that they are necessary in order to match and outgun any potential domestic or cross border threat. You've got the Mexican and South American drug cartels to the South getting their hands on .50 BMGs and Barrett rifles as well as outfitting their vehicles with improvised armor plating. And as we all know, some of the violence from the drug wars and power struggles going on over there have spilled over into our borders, usually catching our police forces by complete surprise, woefully under gunned to take on such threats.

Instead of having one score that is meant to indicate how contributing something is, posts comments should show both the amount of upvotes and downvotes, and downvotes should weigh much less than upvotes in terms of what comments appear first. My main reason for this is one of paving the cowpaths so to speak. Having likes and dislikes is standard for the internet nowadays, so newcomers will almost always treat upvotes and downvotes like such. Using them to show your opinion on something may not be as theoretically important as filtering what's on topic, but it's far more intuitive for human nature.

I think that displaying both scores and keeping downvotes from pushing posts down as much would help with some of the echo chamber nature of many subreddits, especially political subreddits.

Now to the extent of where i'm coming from. There is no way in hell I would usually tell anyone of my situation. As a male, it always brings the implications that i'll also be a rapist. There are two instances that stand out in my mind. The first, was in High school, In my Psychology class. the topic was brought up about whether or not it was ok for the abortion of victims of rape. One ignorant girl went on to exclaim that very notion, He'll also be a rapist. She didn't even take the fact that the baby could be a female. Now, there was a day where I was sitting in the living room watching CNN, and a girl was on CNN talking about her advocacy for children born of rape and raising awareness. If I was in her shoes? What would people think? I think you all know the answer to that. Am I making justifications and creating my own view on the situation? Sometimes I feel like useless garbage. Why do people associate the crime habits of a rapist with the child born from it? I feel like from the male perspective it's a horrible thing even to tell people and it comes with preconceived notions.

However, the amount of hatred and stigma people generally have towards this specific paraphilia is unfair. Let me explain. The essence of the argument is that all people are merely products of their genetics and environment, which they both did not willingly choose. One can hate pedophilia, but not pedophiles or people in general . To hate a person for being a pedophile, or for being anything at all, is to blame that individual for his existence, which he clearly did not choose himself. No one chooses existence, it simply occurs without consent. How can you blame someone or even hate someone for being born with a vulnerable nervous system, or for inheriting dysfunctional genes, or for undergoing childhood trauma, or for being born in an environment full of stressors? If anything, pedophiles should receive our utmost empathy for being the way they are. Just like all people should. Following this line of argument strongly dissipates the grounds for hatred. Of course this does not mean that we should allow pedophiles the ones that don't refrain from acting on their desires to walk freely in public. They should still be imprisoned and receive psychiatric therapy. However, the grounds for imprisonment should not be to punish the pedophile, but rather to minimize public danger and to, if possible, treat the paraphilia. The pedophile should receive psychiatric therapy in order to ensure that the risk for acting on his desires has reached negligible levels. People naturally take the perspective of the victim in this case the child who did not consent to any form of intercourse with the pedophile . Since the victim in question is a child, the empathy generally is amplified, while at the same time the hatred towards the perpetrator is as well. Of course this is natural and of course the victims deserve our utmost support and treatment to overcome the traumatic event. But the pedophile is also a victim, that is something people usually neglect or fail to understand."}, {"conclusion": "I believe there's an uncertainty component in delayed gratification.", "id": 110915, "argument": "If I am given the choice of getting a small reward now, and a bigger one later, there's no problem, I'll pick the bigger one every time unless I need the reward now.

Yeah it Collegehumor but it clearly has a serious intention. It's very short but the point I'm focusing on here is at 0 16. DISCLAIMER Now I'm from Europe and where I live quite a small village we simply don't have and therefore don't know most of these issues at least not to that extend . Infact, most of us are white. Many muslims especially Turkish but they don't stand out that much either. So it this offends you be considerate and think about being in my shoes, with a different society. Browsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners, being from Italian descent I'm a foreigner in Germany myself but I don't look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizza shop just because I'm Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But I'm here to hear you out, from a US perspective. END OF DISCLAIMER Anyway, I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know it's the point to show people that they're being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. But I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. Now if the argument is that it's racist because I'm actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist making a difference on gender ? If the argument to that is Well you didn't choose to like women men but you choose to dislike a race then wouldn't we start to ride a social justice rollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities, traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like you just don't wanna date her because she's ugly You're discriminating ugly people. Maybe you say it's racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they don't necessarily have to meaning it's racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again, what's the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term asian , black , hispanic is putting people into drawers already, so that's racist already, no? Again, I hope not to offend anyone. After all I might be just somewhat ignorant because I don't live in a diverse society like the US. Maybe I'm missing what exactly is the taboo here. Maybe it's just taboo to say it but it's ok to think like that?? I don't know. But doing a little research I also found this asian girl to call herself racist because she refuses to date guys of her own race I just think that IF we call this racist and put the blame here onto people not wanting to date a certain race, then we would start blaming people to be discriminating others for every aspect, watering our preferences down until we truly like everyone equally. Note, my point isn't so much this isn't racist but more the issue that resolves out of blaming people for their sexual preference, even if it comes to someone never wanting to date a certain race. So I'm genuinely curious, this is my first post on r changemyview and I'm open for a new opinion if you could explain me Why should it be called racist to refuse to date a certain race given my arguments above If it is racist, why wouldn't we end up blaming people for refusing to date gingers elder or just ugly people? And finally Aren't we all entitled to any of our sexual preferences without needing to justify them? EDIT Sorry for my poor english, I guess pre judgement is more fitting word than prejudice.

These worries can become even more pronounced in a scenario where the parent is single and finds themselves constantly working and having little time to see let alone talk to their kid. This is where After School Programs or ASP\u2019s come into play. After School Programs are created with the purpose of helping both the child and the parent, it aids the parent by putting their mind at ease knowing they are in an environment that is both safe and productive. And it benefits the child as well as they are able to meet and interact with other children their age and work with those other children to strive towards a common goal. However, a question that has always plagued ASP\u2019s is whether or not they are effective in preventing or discouraging delinquent behavior. The goal of these next few pages is to show you, the reader, the effectiveness of After School Programs and for you to decide whether or not you agree that they are indeed effective and worth the cost and effort. Usually, after school programs invite or allow anyone in their target population in to said programs and activities in order to yield the highest possible results. For an after school program to be effective, it usually has a combination of \u201c1 specific goals, 2 structured programming based on sound educational techniques, and 3 frequent attendance\u201d Aspler, 2009, p. 16 . Attendance is definitely the most problematic as kids begin to grow up and become teenagers. According to a survey in 2001 in Maryland of students who dropped out of the 8 after school programs in question, \u201cDropouts scored significantly more at risk on 11 of 12 indicators than did students who remained in the program for a full year\u201d Aspler, 2009, p. 7 . So after school programs do succeed in reducing the indicators of at risk or delinquent behavior. However, the number 1 reason for these students dropping out was \u201cboredom\u201d Aspler, 2009, p. 7 . So the people in charge of these kinds of programs have to find a balance between interesting and productive. Finding an activity or goal for these young minds that is interesting enough to get many to attend, while at the same time being productive and yielding a positive experience given the resources allotted can prove to be very challenging. According to that same survey, 77 of the 234 total students had dropped out of their respective after school program Aspler, 2009, p. 7 . Aspers article does a great job of describing what makes or breaks an after school program and the statistics back up his claims pretty sufficiently. A newspaper article written by Julie Bail seems to highlight the three principles mentioned in Asplers article. Bail\u2019s article titled \u201cMiddle school success targeted\u201d was published in the Asheville Citizen Times in North Carolina. Her article talks about a local middle after school programs which were created from questions \u201casked what kind of programs teens would like to see\u201d Ball, 2011 . By creating programs based on the interests of the teens in question, Bail\u2019s local middle school was able to create programs that had a specific goal, were grounded in sound educational practices, and nearly guaranteed high attendance as the programs were based on the interests of the students. This also ties well with Victoria Sauer article \u201cAfter School Prevention Programs for At Risk Students Promoting Engagement and Academic Success\u201d which talks a lot about motivation for these students. You must have something that interests the students to \u201cachieve the best possible results\u201d Sauer, 2015, p. 1470 . In Las Vegas, the local law enforcement has their own form of after school program called the \u201cPAL Police Athletic League\u201d Tomaino, 2017 . Captain Christopher Tomaino of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department talked about the league and the idea behind it in an email asking about After School Programs. As a captain he has been a part of many different community building projects and seems to have a grasp on what makes a community project successful. The league was created to \u201cplace socioeconomically at risk kids into various sports programs\u201d Tomaino, 2017 . So unlike the after school program mentioned above, these programs are not education based but sports based and have a much lower dropout rate. This usually serves as a much more interesting after school activity and with it being team based sports, it promotes cooperation, communication, and the idea of a team working towards reaching a common goal, all 3 being positive experiences that can be used later in life. Another important thing to note is all sports in the PAL require participants to meet an academic standard of. This standard encourages players to succeed in school in order to enjoy their sport and be a part of the team, it can also create peer pressure as teammates can try and help push those who are struggling in school to reach a higher standard for themselves both on and off the field. However, there is a huge flaw in this league in Las Vegas is that has a registration fee of 175 . This fee can deter parents from letting their kids join due to the fact they can\u2019t afford to put all their kids into this. Usually, the ones who are prevented from playing are the \u201csocioeconomically at risk kids\u201d that the leagues were created to help Tomaino, 2017 . As of right now, the PAL here in Las Vegas is effective in reducing delinquency for those who can afford it. Even though \u201cgood intentions are important, they are not enough to produce results\u201d Sauer, 2015, p. 1472 . In order for a after school program to be successful, they must have a clearly defined goal, good structure, and high attendance. If those 3 criteria are met than an after school program has a very good chance of being effective in reducing delinquent behavior to those enrolled attending said after school program. For the most part, after school programs are effective for those who attend them and are involved in them frequently as if they have a higher attendance rate, that\u2019s less time for those kids to be put in less than ideal situations. Right now, after school programs are effective for those who stay in, the problem is trying to prevent attrition from these programs and increase attendance. But as stated before, it is hard to create a program that is able to capture the attention of the target audience while staying both positive and affordable. We can see that in Police Athletic Leagues being more effective than more education based AFP\u2019s, but they have smaller populations simply due to the fact it costs money to be a part of those AFP\u2019s. To conclude, their appears to be a correlation between money effort and effectiveness of an AFP. The more resources put in, the more effective that AFP becomes. It is worth the money, time, and effort to try and keep kids from falling into delinquent behavior. It may sound clich\u00e9, but children are easily impressionable and setting a good example by showing them that someone besides their parents cares for them and wants to succeed and can really go a long way."}, {"conclusion": "There are different factors to consider when looking at different relationships, of different sizes, and types.", "id": 14407, "argument": "Professional and personal relationships are forged on completely different things, and respect works very differently: professional and personal degrees of respect are as different of the relationships they're associated with."}, {"conclusion": "Reddit self-promotion works if you get upvoted or downvoted.", "id": 103043, "argument": "I have a few projects that I spend a lot of time with doing music and video.

Body builders vv. Does this mean that if I was a woman who identifies as a woman have much more testosterone than the average woman, I have to be considered a male athlete? Testosterone estrogen progesterone levels can also depend on a variety of things such as race, diet, fetal conditions etc. Considered doping, unnatural, illegal for olympic athletes who are not transgendered. If a transgendered woman can take testosterone hormones and join the male olympic categories, shouldn't a normal woman also be able to as well? The only difference between this transgendered woman and a cis gendered woman is the fact that one identifies himself as a male. Both athlete's physicality's are the same. Changing your hormone level doesn't make you all of the sudden another gender physically. Muscle mass, yes. But what about hand size, joint structure, bone structure, bone density? Therefore I don't think that the level of hormones should determine which sex category athletes should play in. 2 Your gender identification This would appease most people, but also give people to randomly declare themselves whatever gender to participate in categories as they please. If one is able to say I identify myself as a female and is able to play a sport as a female athlete. What stops a 200lb man from saying I identify myself as a 150lb man, I want to wrestle in a lighter weight class. If your identification is purely based on your own mental depiction of yourself Although you can regulate this by putting in rules such as you must have had this gender identity for 4 years etc. You can easily cheat the system by dressing as a different sex and confessing that you had identified with a different gender all your life, but was never able to come out. 3 Biological Sex A clear cut way of determining who plays in which category XX or XY no buts ifs and whys I still believe this is the easiest way to segregate the two categories so my view hasn't changed yet What I realized the past day is that in a world where more than 15 or more people identify themselves as transgendered individuals, there might have to be separate categories other than Women's, Men's categories. This is because if we were to differentiate the two categories based on chromosomes, transgendered people wouldn't be able to play their sport in any category since athletes are not allowed to take hormones dope. And this is why I am so conflicted. I can only think of 3 scenarios Keep the current olympics regulations, apply them to all sports despite controversy. HORMONES ARE THE WAY TO GO. HORMONES DETERMINE WHICH CATEGORY. OR We should just all say f it who cares whos faster or who can swim fastest Appease the transgendered athletes and let them do what they want. Let everyone do whatever they want. OR Say to the transgendered community, Hello, you have your gender which is what you identify yourself as. Great We do too However in order to be in the olympics, you must stop taking hormones and play as an athlete of your biological category because that is the only way the world gets to decide who is naturally the best at which sport.

These things are useful and should be kept around in HS english curriculum. What I'm saying is that the focus on literature particularly fiction within a composition class should be exchanged for more focus on composition and rhetoric. Also, in comp classes, the reading should be more essay based instead of novel or short story based. Likewise, classes that focus exclusively on literature i.e. mandatory lit classes should be replaced entirely in the core curriculum by other, more useful classes. I've searched, and I've yet to come across any good arguments for the retention of Lit class in the mandatory HS cirriculum. Take this article for instance The article is called The Importance of Teaching Literature. It lists five reasons that teaching Lit in HS is important and elaborates on each. To quickly address each point We teach Lit for to develop Cultural Values The article says kids need to be able to understand references to unifying works like the Bible and Shakespeare. I say These literary references especially Shakespeare references are only necessary to understand other literature sure, maybe the odd movie or game now and again references Shakespeare or mirrors his stories in some way, but is it worth it to have a core HS class just to catch these references? On top of that, when was the last time anyone heard of reading the Bible in English class? And do we really want to keep the Bible alive Lit classes tend to make certain works immortal just to preserve a cultural touchstone that delares damnation for homosexual people and other wild stuff? Expanding Horizons The article says Lit can transport us through time and space. We can experience life through another's eyes with Literature. I say We can do the same thing with movies. And especially video games. But if the focus is to transport ourselves into the past, then why not read letters written from the past? Autobiographies? First hand non fiction seems to be more valuable in this regard than fiction does, whether the fiction be in the form of a movie, video game, or book. Also a movie takes 2 hours to watch while a book takes weeks to read and you can get just the same amount of pathos from a good movie as you can from a good book. Building vocabulary Article says Book reading builds an expansive vocab can't disagree here. Better vocabularies lead to more complex discussions. I say First off, literary fiction is not the only place in the world of the written word to find new words. Essayists love a nice, uncommon word, and so do long form reporters. Heck, even some of the past's better letter writers liked to take the old thesaurus out for a spin. This is my main rebuttal to this point fiction is not in any way necessary for building a better vocab. Now for a more personal rebuttal I think that when people use words like rebuttal it's annoying more than anything else. And it distracts from their message. Generally, when a person uses a word like utilize instead of use, or even little harmless words like nor, it just sets off a fedora neck beard alarm in my head and I can't take them seriously anymore. Not saying we should keep people from learning new words or anything just saying that I think people place too much value on an expansive vocabulary. I also realize that I'm a hypocrite, talking about vocab like this, but oh well. Doesn't make the idea that sometimes a bigger vocab is just annoying wrong. Improving writing skills Article says More you read the better you write can't disagree. I say All types of writing are not created equal. Reading lit fiction will not help you improve your practical writing skills, like e mail writing, persuasive writing, or tech writing. Reading more lit helps you write better lit but we can't just be reading lit for the sake of writing more of it. That seems ridiculous. And even if you see a lot of value in lit itself, its got to be mostly aesthetic value, and we shouldn't teach a core class in lit just because lit is pretty writing, wouldn't you agree? Teaching critical thinking Article says With so much malicious sensory data out there these days, students need to learn to think critically I agree. Literature is the best way to do this. I say Why not protect kids from groupthink by having them deconstruct advertisements or political rhetoric directly? I remember doing some of this in an english class of mine it was eye opening. But for some reason we only did it for a class period or two before it was back to lit. I know that these points aren't perfect representations of the points in the article, but I just wanted to address a few straw men before I let you ers at me. Also, there are so many subjects that could take the place of Lit in high school classrooms Philosophy and computer programming are two good ones. In fact, philosophy sounds like a perfect class to develop your critical thinking skills in. It sounds like a better way to teach critical thinking than lit, anyway."}, {"conclusion": "Caster Semenya should be allowed to compete against women without having to take medication to lower her testosterone.", "id": 55532, "argument": "Caster Semenya is a cisgender female.

In terms of people, estimates put populations of native americans between 1 18 million pre colonization. Today, there are only 3 million.

The number of broken native american treaties would be a ridiculously comical number to try to discover. I feel that the culture has not adaquately redressed this issue. We barely think or are influenced by native american culture at all in our daily lives. The US is an example of a place where you can wipe out a culture succesfully, and life continues on without anyone feeling too miffed about it.

So a few years ago there I read a quick post by a wise old basement hermit near the front page of r 4chan. He made multiple points on women life that he had learnt over the years. A surprising amount seemed well thought out and true. So it comes to a quick blatant sentence which was essentially women do not know honour, don't interact with them as if they do . At first it seems like a terribly wrong, provocative statement the idea that the brain can be somehow 'wired' that differently for females males doesn't make much sense but when given a bit of thought it had some merits. If we consider males and females more animalistically there are still clear traits that stick out from evolution instinctual behaviour. One is the male's behaviour to seek out and impress females. Of course as with animals this leads to challenges between males where the more dominant male has children evolution etc. Despite social boundaries this behaviour is still vaguely driven in society and potentially leads to social behaviours between males where the defeated must accept defeat and the winner also acknowledges that there he had the potential to be in a similar circumstance. Females did not evolve with this hard wired thinking through challenge and adversity and therefore do not have as much understanding of it and the sense of 'honour' that encompasses how to do behave in these circumstances. Obviously there are specific exceptions to this but the general point still remains. I am aware that the initial idea potentially came from a man who could have never had many real experiences interacting with the opposite gender. I am pretty keen for someone to cmv, could be a challenge but I am open to some fresh thoughts. Edit As I suspected this is quite a hard view to define in words, both due to specific meanings of the word 'honour' and my use of evolutionary behaviours to help define the argument. Should put a \u2206 here as I didn't consider the more defined sense of honour that I am writing about until after the definition was asked. Final edit unfortunately partly due to my attempted description there are many misunderstandings of the exact idea I am trying to convey. Largely this is due to assumptions that the 'honour' I am referring to is in a moral sense and not the definition I am attempting to describe. So in the end I have Through instinctual behaviour and social constructs males can be driven to behave in certain specific ways to find a mate. Between males there developed certain 'rules' in order to achieve this whilst also behaving appropriately to be seen as 'decent' amongst other males. These rules were extended to other aspects such as warfare and duelling. Parts of these rules can be described as honour again, not the same honour as moral honour which most people have, different meaning . Apart from certain circumstances where women are also placed in these roles they do not experience this facet of life as much and therefore do not have as much experience in the form and idea of 'honour' that goes with it. Thanks for all the input, I don't feel strongly at all about this topic I just like a good little argument discussion. \u2206 perhaps a better word to use would be a 'code of conduct' in the situations that arise when competing. It is likely that women too have something similar that men do not understand as well. Due to the different social influences both have different methods and are better versed in their use as the opposite sex. Edit ok I initially felt like I didn't need to say this but this idea is just a thought, I don't strongly believe in it and it is in no way saying somehow that men are better or worse than women. To illustrate the point I have used some upfront language but it is only to point out differences that are not necessarily bad or good. Disagreeing with it because it seems sexist without attempting to understand the message is a close to the conversation, which is a shame as some ideas should be thought of even if they offend.

All that happened was that they met a quota based upon genitalia first and foremost. Another example can be the push for the film Black Panther. It was called the first Black superhero film and lauded as such even though it just isn't. Finally it reached a point where people were busing in kids to see it for no other reason than their skin color.  gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Robots shall inherit the cosmos.", "id": 18022, "argument": "Today, a big reason we send humans into space at all \u2014 besides flag waving politics \u2014 is to see how human beings fare in space. Unfortunately, it turns out that humans are squishy, fragile little bags of mostly water that burst pretty easily and fry up fast. Every time a human is sent into space, it is with a whole cocoon of life support that is 100x more complicated than just sending a machine. The obvious requirements for humans are tricky enough as it is oxygen, pressurization, climate control, food and water, rest, heavy radiation shielding, somewhere for the poop to go, etc. Keeping humans up in space for very long, or sending them anywhere interesting, presents even greater challenges. Human bodies actually disintegrate without gravity, for example. 15 of our waking hours in space must be spent just exercising enough to stave off permanent disability. Once you get beyond the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, the harsh radiation of deep space is enough to require hardened shielding \u2013 and we\u2019re actually not really sure what would happen to humans exposed to even that residual amount for very long. Like, say, on a trip to Mars. Indeed, it turns out that robots can do pretty much everything humans can in space, except more easily, faster and far, far cheaper. This is such a completely obvious point that almost no one denies it , but it\u2019s worth pointing out anyway. Robotic probes like Cassini, Curiosity and the Solar Dynamics Observatory among many others have already done some amazing scientific research which is simply impossible for humans. Not only can robot probes operate for far longer and collect more data, but they also have far greater latitude in adjusting their mission agenda on the basis of new discoveries. And because politics is never far from space exploration, it\u2019s fair to mention that catastrophic loss of a robot spacecraft does not engender anywhere near the same political heat that losing humans does. Just getting into outer space is extremely expensive \u2014 staying there is way, way more so. By low estimates, just keeping the lights on in the International Space Station costs 350,000 per hour \u2014 and it\u2019s already there, and built Even in a permanent structure on the Moon, Mars or anywhere else \u2014 which will be terrifically costly to construct, with tech we don\u2019t have yet \u2014 just generating enough water, oxygen, food, heat, pressure and radiation protection to sustain human life will remain expensive. It will always cost more to support a human in space than on Earth, our natural habitat, and this fact is probably all but immune to advances in technology . Robots and artificial Intelligence on the other hand, can be built to withstand almost anything that outer space throws at them with much lower cost. Robots have already made it further into space than any human can dream of in the next century, because the cost and political risk is much lower. In the relatively near future as robotics becomes more adaptable, capable of reproduction von neumann probes and resilient to damage and radiation, And as artificial intelligence becomes more autonomous. The future of space exploration and colonization will probably belong to sapient AI. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

I am fully on board with getting rid of plastic bags. However I have a big problem with how it is being conducted as I'm sure many other people do. The main problem I have is that supermarkets are removing the one way for people to throw away rubbish and food scraps. It is no good removing plastic bags while continuing to sell products that are wrapped in plastics. Supermarket chains obviously do not care about the environment and are only doing this to increase revenue by providing bags which cost and of which they know people will forget. I believe that before getting rid of plastic bags, these supermarkets should have phased out products made of plastic and other rubbish. Which they have not done. Which will eventually lead to people having lots of rubbish and no bags to throw them out in. Thus they will buy plastic bags and there will be no improvement in the environment. However if the supermarkets flat out refused to sell these kinds of products then that would be of much greater benefit. If all packing is recyclable then there would be significantly less rubbish, plus all food scraps will then be more likely to be used in compost. I guess I just find it hard to believe that people are applauding them for getting rid of plastic bags when it won't actually do any good for the environment. So what I'm looking for is for someone to show me how supermarkets not providing plastic bags and doing nothing else to assist is actually beneficial to the environment."}, {"conclusion": "Raising the regular Continental Army was one of Congress' first orders of business during the Revolution.

I no longer believe there is available to me presently, vat grown stuff is looking pretty neat such a thing as 'humane' eggs or dairy among other examples, egg laying hen breeders kill roosters when they are still chicks and dairy cows are forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them. I understand that there's no way to completely avoid harming another creature, especially in our current industrial agriculture system, but I think it's my responsibility to reduce the harm I do as much as I can. I live in the U.S., have a good income, real consistent access to vegan alternatives, and have never experienced health problems from not eating animal products. Yet, I'm still struggling. Even after I added a 'freegan' clause that I can eat animal products I am not paying for that would otherwise be thrown away just as I can buy used leather shoes I'm not contributing to demand for the product , I often give in to temptation when, say, ice cream is on the table.

In it, you will find quantitative as well as qualitative data regarding sexual assault allegations as they go start to finish through the British justice system. They place the overall rate of false allegations in their time period at 2.9 . Pages 35 77, Understanding Attrition are particularly illuminating. They reveal, in overwhelming majority, a process that is simply incredibly hard to go through, one in which accusers are heavily doubted from the outset, in which genuine seeming allegations are recanted due to police pressure especially those coming from disadvantaged people , and in which a false allegation would be burned into a husk in micro seconds. My view is changed to agree with the 2 8 rate for false allegations that end up in front of the police. Thanks so much to Grape and to all who joined the discussion OP below I have been struck by the bloggers and talking heads all repeating the 2 figure, while at the same time I was reading accounts by trial lawyers who all seemed to place the rate much higher. With no agenda, I grew curious about this statistic and checked into it. The overwhelming consensus is that the 2 rate is a fiction. There is no extant study that comes to a conclusion of 2 . It was an anecdotal figure, possibly from the 1970s, that got bounced around the academic echo chamber until it gained artificial weight. Check here for a good overview of the issue. The FBI puts the rate of unfounded allegations at 8 . It should be remembered, however, that the FBI collects that data by simply polling police departments nationwide, and each department has its own threshold for unfounding an allegation, which adds a lot of murkiness to the figure. I think the 8 rate tells us more about police procedures than anything concrete about the actual amount of false claims. Nevertheless, the 8 rate means that rape allegations are deemed unfounded four times more often than allegations of any other crime. A peer reviewed study that I consider quite convincing was performed in 1994 by a Eugene Kanin of Purdue University. He studied one town from the years of 1978 1987 and two universities from the years of 1985 1988. In all three of those places, violent felonies were rare and all rape allegations were pursued to closure. The only basis for unfounding an allegation was the recantation of the accuser. The false accusation rate was 41 in the town and 50 between the two universities. The consensus also seems to be that the overall number of false claims will always be a dark, i.e. unknowable, figure. That is certainly true, although I think Kanin's study comes the closest to shedding real light on that figure. I think we are looking at something closer to Kanin's figures, maybe a little lower generally speaking, as the real rate of false claims. TL DR The 2 rate is a fiction, the 8 rate is based on partly flawed data collection, and I am growing more convinced by a ~40 rate as studied by a professor from Purdue. Edit 1 added FBI source link.

The America I know is a country with two political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. It is a representative democracy that prevents the violent transfer of power through the elections process. It prevents the abuse of power by separating it and creating artificial checks and balances. It is a country with no official religion but a Christian background, with a tolerant and diverse population. It has a mixed economy with social programs of various kinds and a market. Why do I see that ending? I do not believe there are checks and balances on the current government, and I believe those in power will abuse it. I believe we are in a temporary one party state that will become a permanent one party state. And finally, I believe that our rulers have become unhinged from reality and factual evidence. I believe the new America has one party, the Republicans. I believe that elections are already setup exclusively to their benefit and that we are no longer democratically represented, as a minority party has total and complete control. I believe that Republicans will abuse their legislative and executive power to further suppress the vote of minorities and liberals based on examples in North Carolina, if we even get to the point that we still have elections. And I am not certain that will be the case, as I can too easily see Donald Trump claiming victory in the face of a loss and calling on the military and legislature to make it so. I believe the checks and balances in our system have been eliminated or will be eliminated to further the power of the rightwing. The Republican legislature doesn't check the power of Trump, and Trump's executive office is already simply ignoring the judicial branch. The rightwing already draw their own districts and have their own propaganda, preventing them from being voted out of power or having their supporters turn against them. No amount of popular dissent can remove them from power because power assent didn't place them there. I believe Trump cannot be impeached or removed from power. As Democrats have no federal power, impeachment would rely on Republicans and they have shown nothing but complete and total support. They have no fear of majority disapproval because only 11 Congressmen are in districts or states lost by Trump, and thus the only people whose opinion matters are Republican voters that wildly support Trump's authoritarian power grabs. I believe that the rightwing will take the steps to ensure an authoritarian Christian theocracy. His Supreme Court pick s will adhere to a Christian dominionist philosophy that holds that the First Amendment only applies to Christianity, protections against church interference in politics will be removed, and non Christians will lose rights and be a legal target of discrimination. I believe that in addition to the rise of Christian theocracy we become an intolerant, white supremacist country that does not give immigrants or minorities equal rights or protection under the law, starting at the highest level with Trump and Bannon. I believe that we are a single Reichstag Fire away from the end of the rule of law as Trump and his supporters will rally to remove any opposition, constitution be damned, to the point of forcibly removing dissenters in the judiciary branch. I believe that Trump will start an unethical war very early on in his tenure against China or Iran to generate popularity, and that this war might lead to a world war or the use of nuclear weapons. I believe that Trump and the Republican party are compromised by Russia, leading to the above actions against China as well as other economic and military decisions that will only benefit the Russians. I believe that most if not all of the Russian dossier is true, that Trump and his aids stand to earn billions by cooperating with Russia and that the RNC and Trump are currently being blackmailed. I believe that our economy will collapse and bring the world with it, as Trump's micromanagement creating tariffs and trade wars and abuse of the deregulation causes a collapse of the dollar, a wholesale depression and a collapse of the banking system this time, without the bailout that kept it afloat in 2008 . Social programs preventing the total collapse will be scrapped at every level as austerity measures which will worsen the collapse. I believe that fundamentally those in power are not attached to reality. I disagree with them not just on matters of opinion, where some debate will always exist, but on the very idea that facts are knowable. If they used facts and came to a different conclusion, then perhaps they could still create effective policy. But if they deny basic truths, then they will create policies that do not match up to reality. In short, I am terrified that we have an abusive government with no checks or balances to its abuse, who fundamentally stands for everything I do not. I do not feel like a citizen, I feel like an enemy in a hostile state. I don't feel like my rights or views will continue be upheld by the rule of law nor that a peaceful transition of power is still possible in the face of a President that denies losing even the popular vote and a Republican Congress that cannot move to impeach. The best case scenario in my mind is that the economic collapse does not occur immediately and we merely descend to an autocratic state with little respect for our past laws with some pretense at elections. I don't even know what the worst case scenario is. Basically, I'm looking to be talked off the ledge figuratively speaking . gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

I absolutely feel that wages need to increase in this country USA . I do think that a person should be able to work a minimum wage job and live comfortably. I am strictly arguing the popular 15 hr for all is not the best method to approach the problem. Here are the reasons why people are demanding a 15 hr minimum wage minimum wage has not kept up with inflation the last minimum wage increase was nearly 10 years ago the current minimum wage is not enough to afford a home rent cost of living those being paid minimum wage often have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet Here is why I think raising minimum wage to 15 is not a great solution this will strongly encourage companies to implement machines robots to replace low paying jobs. It's already a problem in places like McDonalds, but it will only be exacerbated by this sudden wage increase. those who strongly believe in 15 hr minimum wage think that their job will be safe and it will be jobs of other people that will be let go. By simple mathematical deduction we know this wont be the case. the businesses hurt the most by this are small to medium size companies, local restaurants, and mom and pop shops. Big corporations are able to withstand the blow to their bottom line and can persevere. the middle class will become even smaller. It's tough enough having the wealthy shit on the entire country with their power and influence in the current political landscape, now the lower class is cutting the middle class at the knees. Essentially, everyone in the middle class will immediately be devalued, while the upper class will continue to loom over us all. a broad stroke solution doesn't fit in all cities, counties, and metro areas. Small towns will collapse under the economic pressure. My proposed solution Minimum wage for a city should be a mandated percentage of the cost of living for a city or county. For example, if in a city the average cost of rent is 1000 mo and the average mortgage is 600 mo, with essential utilities and food costs an additional 500. For this particular city, cost of living is 1300. The minimum wage should be 1 of the cost of living. In this case 13 hr. This will earn someone roughly 1700 per month after taxes. Very doable if you have dual income household. In another city where the cost of living is lower, like 900 mo, the minimum wage will be 9 hr. This is just a proposed idea and not the crux of my argument. The point I'm making is that a more calculated and precise method of wage increase needs to be implemented.

I know the crimes he masterminded were heinous and I know California has an OBSCENELY long memory about the Manson Family but I think that their approaching of this is all wrong. Manson is 81 and even in a state where the elderly do things from still influence pop culture Hugh Hefner, Stan Lee, Betty White to represent the state in politics Dianne Feinstein most are doddering, frail, ornery, and a health risk. Add in being incarcerated for nearly 50 years and there is a risk that being exposed to the modern world would cause them a shock they might never adapt to. A paroled elderly ex convict is probably of little harm to others and the world because of their long incarcerated state and advanced age and if we let them all free what harm would it do to the world? I know that specifically to Manson there is a default view of a worst case scenario which has kept him in indefinite AdSeg for a string of reasons he would restart The Family in the general population and denying people in general the chance to get notoriety for killing him the two big ones but this is shameful. Orchestrate a crime ring and get protection from harm, disease, and death while tons of law abiding Californians struggle to get food, healthcare, and affordable housing.

For the purposes of ease of discussion, let's focus on mutants . However, said stories also usually feature criminal mutants who kill people with their powers, as well as mutants who struggle not to kill people on accident. While I would not support an indiscriminate policy of making mutants second class citizens, I would say that a multi tier registration of mutants, their powers, and their psychological health would be beneficial to both mutants and non mutants. This is what I would suggest Blue Has no mutation credit to u ralph j , or has a mutation, but said mutation is harmless. Examples changing hair color at will, voluntary bio luminescence. Green Has a mutation that could cause harm if used improperly, but has been evaluated as psychologically stable. Examples the nicer Marvel super heroes. Yellow Has a mutation that could cause harm or kill if used improperly, and has been evaluated as having psychological issues that could lead to improper use of said mutation. Examples the more unstable Marvel super heroes. Red Has a mutation that could cause mass casualties if used improperly, but has been evaluated as psychologically stable. Examples Charles Xavier. Black Has a mutation that could cause mass casualties if used improperly, and has been evaluated as psychologically unstable, or shown to be willing to use said mutation in extremely violent ways. Examples Ted the nuclear guy from Heroes, Magneto. Blue and Green would be subject to little more than a yearly evaluation of powers and mental state. Yellow would be provided mandatory psychological counseling. Red would need to submit to constant tracking by the government, and Black would require immediate imprisonment institutionalization, as would be appropriate. Furthermore, a public database could be created to catalog those Yellow and above, something like the Sex Offender registry today. Credit to u vl99 for pointing out that a database could cause just as much harm as it would prevent. Problems with said program If there is no way to determine what powers a person has, they could simply lie. This will not fix anti mutant sentiment. Blues and Greens would probably still feel a need to hide their status.

Knowledge is a subset of belief traditionally defined as JTB Justified True Belief you must have a reason for the belief and the belief must correspond to reality in order to be classified as knowledge. My view is that we cannot directly change our beliefs by an act of will. This is because, imo, beliefs are acquired through being convinced, and I see no point at which in being convinced that volition comes into play. There is something to be said for indirectly choosing one's beliefs. For example we've all seen those Point Counterpoint books on certain controversial topics. There will be one on abortion and all the even chapters will argue why it should be illegal and all the odd numbrered chapters will argue the opposite. It is very easy to only read one side, often the side we agree with. Doing this, we limit our exposure to ideas which might convince us into believing something different. I call this Closing the book. Thus, by closing the book, we can indirectly choose our beliefs. But this is different than what I'm talking about overall.

It is impossible for a member of the electorate to have an equal or higher amount of information about any matter than a decision maker in the government.

Another note when I say mass extinction, I mean a loss of biodiversity, not the extinction of humanity. I elaborate on this further in this post.

You just hear so many horror stories of oceans choked with plastic, lack of effort on climate change, invasive species, and maladies like white nose syndrome and colony collapse syndrome. There was that story of a rhino species dying out recently. It just feels so frustrating I keep feeling that the natural world is beyond saving not because humanity can't save it, but because it won't . It feels like we're spectacularly shortsighted I mean, for many, the choice between an act that provides short term gain, but long term environmental destruction and an act that requires short term sacrifice for environmental gain that the actor may not even live to see is a no brainer We know what we're doing, but we keep doing it anyway, because we can't imagine things being any different. All of the dominant systems around the world are built on the exploitation of nature. To get them to stop doing so would be practically remaking if not outright destroying human civilization. Sure, environmentalists may get in a few short term victories, but in the long run, it's all meaningless. The system snaps right back to your regularly scheduled exploitation. It's not just a nebulous group of industrialists, lobbyists, or politicians that environmentalists are fighting. It's entire cultures, global economic systems, and hard set ideals. I've heard about the tragedy of the commons and the tyranny of small decisions . That should show you how difficult it is to get humanity at large to change its ways. I keep running into what TvTropes calls, Inherent in the System It feels like the only way for the natural world to recover is if humanity were to go extinct itself. Seeing some of the stuff we've gotten away with, I often wonder if humanity deserves that fate. I know how that must sound. It's just that if humanity were to escape this extinction period, it would feel like we'd have gotten away with a colossal injustice.

If there are things that make dialogue good , then those things can be taught. You could argue that, say, there are so many rules to natural speaking that it's basically impossible to explicitly teach that without a bunch of linguistics classes, or that the best way to learn what natural speaking sounds like is to actually listen to people rather than trying to learn from a textbook, but none of those imply that it is somehow unteachable . In a more general sense, I think that xyz can't be taught is often used as a hand waving excuse to gloss over a topic because it would take too much time to teach, or it's used to mean I can try to show you, but I can't make you learn it, which is true with literally anything. An example of I can try to show it to you, but I can't make you learn it might be Passion isn't something that can be taught learned. I think that passion is absolutely something that can be taught.

I'm not inherently anti market or anti existence of rich people, but AFAIK a system like the Cuban one is the only one that has truly allowed everyone to be middle class or better. I don't mean the system used in Cuba specifically hereditary dictatorships aren't my thing, although I'm hesitant to say I'm in favour of full democracy because people tend to vote in free market quick fixers that end up fucking them over ie Russia in the 90s , but rather a system based on state owned industry, with limited personal property ownership, some private commerce, and universal free social programs up to post secondary education and all healthcare. Also, accusations of hypocrisy won't work to change my view. I live in a wealthy country, and although my family is poor I still probably have a higher standard of living than I would under a socialist system. Nevertheless I think it is the morally correct thing to do, if not necessarily the pragmatic thing , to adopt a socialist system. EDIT I think the OP is unclear on what I mean by standards of living What I really mean is less access to the stuff that capitalism produces. Fancy kitchen gadgets, Netflix subscriptions, memory foam mattresses. That stuff wouldn't be available under a socialist system. But I don't think stuff is necessary for leading a fulfilling life.

Regardless, seeing how FOSS free and open source software stacks up against closed proprietary software, it would seem like a no brainer to use it in government. A few points to consider are Open source technology ensures that anyone can see what goes into a program. This allows bugs and security holes to be found and repaired faster. Also, it weeds out the contributions of less qualified people since their algorithms will be replaced with better ones from more experienced qualified people. Open source prevents unapproved or suspicious modifications to the programs. It's hard to slip bad code through when, theoretically, every citizen can see how the entire code. Employing open source is a step towards transparency in government as a whole. If all the raw data government agencies churn out are publicly available, this will ensure consistency when some of that information is used by the media or other agencies. Also makes fact checking easier. Reduced cost. Instead of paying someone to use their own proprietary algorithms, a lot if not all of the work can be done for the low price of free or very little. Plus, you can check out their algorithm yourself. I have especially wondered if there are any downsides to successfully implementing this in light of the United States' healthcare website fiasco. I am sure an open source community would create a usable system backend and frontend on time and for less than what it cost taxpayers I admit, I don't have the exact dollar amount for how much the website cost to get up . Even if only the frontend was open sourced, you'd get good ideas recommendations for how best to set up the backend, and the GUI would actually make sense. Another area that could benefit from an open source mentality is voting software once again, applies strongly to Murica . How is a whole country OK with some private company owning voting machines and the software that counts the votes?? Finally, imagine if your state DMV or veterans benefit applications websites were designed by people who actually used them. Even if they couldn't program or design, their contribution would be invaluable in determining how the end product looks and functions. Note that this level of transparency wouldn't necessarily apply to military, national defense or other security data tools.

I would like to state my opinion and I would like someone with a good argument and evidence to change my view. Many for profit schools across the country are marketed as quicker and easier routes to a job, profession, or trade. From what I have read, these schools are not accredited by an organization that is recognized by the majority of traditional American colleges and the credits are not transferable. The education you get from these colleges are mediocre at best, and they often lie about their credentials. Sources for the above statements It is my understanding that these schools are usually expensive, and often leave the unemployed graduate in crippling debt. Many of these students end up defaulting on their loans and destroying their whole lives over a false promise that the US government supports by granting them the means to obtain that education through loans. Furthermore, and this is where I have some expertise, I believe that for profit medical schools in the Caribbean, which market themselves as an alternative route for US citizens to become doctors, fall along these same lines. These schools accept thousands and thousands of applicants every year who did not have the credentials, grades, or ability to be accepted by a US medical school. The acceptance criteria are many standards of deviation lower when compared to those of US medical schools. These schools charge outrageous prices for the education, with the average debt from a Caribbean program being 300,000 500,000. Each student is eligible to receive federal funding to attend these off shore institutions. However, these schools are incredibly poor at placing their graduates into jobs as resident physicians. Only 33 of all the students who enter into an off shore medical school makes it to graduation and obtains a position inside the US. The rest are left with a worthless degree and crippling debt they are never able to pay off. The US government currently pays for US citizens to attend these offshore scam schools not just medical schools , and the schools can charge in tuition whatever they wish, because the government would fund them. Sources below I firmly believe that for profit institutions and offshore medical schools are working only for their investors and consider the student nothing more than the product. We need to end US government financial support to students who choose to attend them. I don't care so much that they exist, but that US taxpayer dollars are paying for these scams to exist.

PLEASE PROVIDE SOME SORT OF PROOF OR SUPPORTING LOGIC. THANKS. First Contact is the discovery of alien life, and by dramatic upheaval, I mean something quick that causes society to breakdown. If we received radio transmissions from aliens tomorrow or some other form of proof that incontestably proved the existence of advanced alien life, I don t think our lives would fundamentally change. The basics of living and being human would still be the same, and it would change nothing but high level government policy and a handful of doctrines for the time being. I don't think many people would riot or kill themselves or start new wars. I don't think that we'd be unified as a species or tolerate each other that much more or receive some sort of spiritual awakening. Each doctrine and philosophy would slightly adjust itself to account for the new possibility, but most intelligent people have probably already accounted for the vague possibility of life outside earth. The immediacy makes little difference. Of course, in the long run, the human race would be changed significantly. But immediate term shifting of strategic priorities, political talking points, and art aren't what I mean by a dramatic upheaval. An upheaval to me is a mass panic or something like it. I believe that people pretty much tend to stick together when shit goes down. For example, in response to major terrorist attacks, people have been found to stick around and help. Genuine panic is actually quite rare. In this study on morale during WW2 and panic caused by modern terror incidents, panic is usually a limited spike of quiet grief, and people really only tend to evacuate if forced to or if their houses are destroyed. EDIT I'm assuming a peaceful sort of contact, like picking up radio signals or seeing a probe.

Before you massively downvote this based off the title let me clear some things up. Rape is one of the worst things imaginable. I have family and friends who have been raped and I am in no way trying to victim blame, the only person responsible for rape is the rapist themselves. I have never been raped, I obviously can't speak on behalf of those who have, and I know the fallout that comes from coming forward against your accuser can be life altering. One of my closest friends and her sister were raped and came out against her assaulter, after a year of trials and testimonies he was left off scott free. It was incredibly traumatizing for both of them and they both regretted coming forward because they didn't have faith in the justice system to make the rapist pay. I know this isn't an isolated incident, ESPECIALLY against people with power. When I say rape victims I mean men and women. That being said , I think there's a duty for rape victims to immediately come out against their assaulter, otherwise their assaulter gets the idea that what their doing is acceptable since they didn't have any consequences from it and will continue to assault people. If your home was burglarized wouldn't you immediately report it? If there was a string of burglaries in your neighborhood and nobody reported it, nobody else would know to take steps to protect themselves. It isn't the home owner's fault they're being burglarized, but it seems like there should be a duty to not only inform others it is happening so they can protect themselves, but to hopefully get the person caught. Again, the only person responsible for rape is the rapist. However, it's just hard to not think that there are many victims who wouldn't have been assaulted if the first person a serial rapist attacked had immediately come forward.  Edit I think the biggest take away from these responses is that in a society where rape is treated more seriously and reports were better handled, it would be more likely people would want to come forward and prevent their rapist from continuing their crimes. However, as many people have stated, rape reports rarely result in convictions and their lives are overturned because of their accusations and despite knowing how it feels to be raped and how horrible it is, the urgency of self preservation is more than the need to possibly prevent it from happening to a complete stranger."}, {"conclusion": "Even if I go to a private Christian school, then I shouldn't have to be required to take bible classes.", "id": 93003, "argument": "I go to a private Christian school, and for awhile I have not been a Christian.

Even in Africa, many countries Algeria, South Africa, Kenya are already below 3.0, and as prosperity eventually makes its way to the other countries of that continent, global experience suggests that fertility there will decline too. Accordingly, and very roughly, we are not long before the moment of peak humanity somewhere between nine and eleven billion people, and somewhere between 2040 and 2060. What concerns me is what happens on the far side of that peak, and what measures might be taken to prevent it, none of which seems likely to reverse the trend. I believe that these measures won't work 1 Family friendly social policies Consider Denmark or Sweden, with among the most generous social policies on the planet Fertility is roughly 1.8 in each place.

It might reduce the rate at which the population declines, but it won't change the long term trend. 3 Exogestation I can also imagine medical science making it possible to gestate a child outside the human body. Leaving aside the question of whether this is a good idea, I don't see that it changes the challenges of actually raising a child. 4 Creches It's possible to conceive of private or government run creches or orphanages that raise children in larger numbers than typical families. Leaving aside the question of whether this is a good idea either, it seems to me that it's not deployable at a scale sufficient to make a demographic difference. The creches would have to be run by people, obviously, and if it were easy to raise children in quantity, and expense were no issue in a prosperous future, then such people would presumptively choose to raise their own large families. 5 Fertility friendly subcultures Some religious and other minorities Haredim in Israel, Mormons and Quiverful Christians in the US, for example tend towards large families for cultural reasons. This might make a short term and localized difference, but I am not convinced that these minorities can propagate their large families over multiple generations to secure a significant demographic impact. You might meet someone with ten children, but you're unlikely to meet someone with a hundred grandchildren. And the current fertility rate in Utah, for one example, is 2.24 and dropping. 6 Fertility mandates Aggressive government policies to maintain fertility sort of a reversal of China's one child policy withholding of benefits until you have the third child, or something like that seem unlikely to be tolerable. People are reasonably and necessarily private and possessive about matters of family, and to make a difference, a government would have to enforce such a policy for a century or two. 7 Change in social status of large families There's a piece in the NYT from April 2014 suggesting that wealthy Manhattanites are finding larger families to be a social signifier of prosperity. This one seems self correcting to me. After all, if it becomes commonplace enough to make a difference demographically, there's hardly any cachet to it. So, the solution to the problem of long term demographic decline and fading of the human species is for millions upon millions of women, as a matter of course and routine, to choose to have third children. And we have learned from the experience of the last fifty years of convenient fertility control that they won't. It won't all be bad, I suppose. The earth will get a chance to catch its breath, we can allow major parts of the planet to return to nature, and as prosperity propagates more widely one can imagine and look forward to a couple of hundred years' golden age of art, creativity, science, and progress. We'll have to figure out a new sort of economics endless growth isn't realistic. Japan might have something to offer here the population there has been between 120 and 130 million since 1984, while the economy has grown from about 1 trillion USD to as much as 6 trillion. But a great deal of Japanese economic activity is driven by exports, and on a global basis, there isn't anyplace to export to, or to emigrate from for that matter. In conclusion, although we are subject, as a species, to any number of catastrophes, including climate change, plague, war, or some technological horror, an optimistic view suggests we stand a reasonably good chance of avoiding the worst consequences of these ills. But our alternative to catastrophic decline appears to be a graceful, quiet decline over a millennium or two. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

I get that imprisoning guys left and right for whatever reason can be scrounged up is a long American tradition just not a proud one but what exactly is the point? Who is this helping? The offender? No. Society? Not even a little. I also don't think they should be put on that God awful sex offender registry. That thing should ONLY be for people who are a threat to the neighborhood.

The purpose of Megan's Law is to protect children period. How does this do that? Pedophiles are not destined to become child molesters. There's this thing we all agree on Rape is about power, not sex. How and why does this change because the victim is a child? There's a Harvard study that says pedophiles are most likely going to harm children in some way or other that always pops up when this assertion is made that I can't find at the moment, sorry. But assuredly someone is bound to cite it sooner or later here but the key thing from that study that everyone willfully ignores the sample of pedophiles interviewed for the study were in prison at the time , so it's not a wild leap to say that they were all there for harming children. I mean imagine your brother came to you today and said I'm a pedophile . Would you ever trust him around your kids alone, ever again? This guy you've known your whole life and I'd bet you a million dollars you'd treat him the same way you would treat a dirty vagrant around your kids. Why would a pedophile ever share this life ruining secret with anyone, ever? It's impossible to know how many pedophiles are out there because of that. Putting them in therapy to help channel their sexuality in a way that won't harm kids. This makes your children safer. Who wouldn't take a teeny, tiny tax increase that directly makes kids safer? Therapy is expensive and the price tag is a major barrier for people taking the step to get help. A nameless, random face on the internet will almost never be attached to an identity, so the victim in the picture will likely never be found, and the best justice you can salvage from the situation is that someone gets help for their dangerous habit. Throwing that guy in jail for having her picture doesn't make one ounce of a difference to that girl. At least this way, you're helping someone .

While there are still lots of activists and politicians working against this type of spying, public outrage has largely settled and I even get the impression that many people are starting to accept wide spread surveillance as the norm. This might be overly simplistic but an example would be assuming you smoke , when your parents first caught you smoking. When they didn't know and you were trying to keep them in the dark about it you were careful and probably smoked less for fear of getting caught. After they found out and assuming you still smoked after that , you smoked more and could give a shit about the consequences. Anyway I guess that's my point.

So even though society's view of what is attractive changes over time and vary by culture healthiness has almost always been considered attractive. Just because someone has the right to be fat doesn't mean I have to think they are hot there is a difference between tolerance and being attracted to someone. This might be a far fetched analogy, but if someone chooses to not bathe ever then that is their right. But I don't think that is attractive and that is my choice. Also, because I know this will be a counter argument, people who are skinny to the point of being unhealthy are considered attractive so how is that justified?

Preface Christoph Waltz is a great actor whom I enjoy very much, and he acted the part well. It's not his fault that Oberhauser's character was limited, and without his artistry, Oberhauser would probably have been even worse. Furthermore, I think that Spectre as an organization was a great antagonist, and was appreciably sinister, so I'm not throwing out the entire premise of the film. My contention is that Oberhauser's relationship with James Bond is forced. The whole cuckoo in the nest angle was treated in far too cavalier a fashion, essentially thrown in as an excuse for personal animosity between Bond and Oberhauser. What little foreshadowing and build up there was consisted of negligible tension or style, i.e. several old photographs. Oberhauser's persona is that of a genial megalomaniac, overseeing a vast conglomerate like society of shadows. An Eichmann type who happily and efficiently chairs the unspeakable. Then, when he captures Bond, there's a dramatic shift in his character, where now his motivation is a personal vendetta with Bond. Indeed, his preoccupation with Bond, and with witnessing Bond's demise, leads to his own downfall, as he needlessly travels to London, and places himself in the centre of unfolding events. Does this shift in character make sense? I think it rests upon the scenes following Bond's capture in the desert, and whether or not they're effective, as this is when the justificatory reveal occurs. In short, after Bond was orphaned he lived with the Oberhauser family, and Franz Oberhauser, Bond's adoptive brother, was jealous of Bond to such a degree that he murdered his own father. I have three problems with this. Firstly, as stated earlier, this is not a well timed crescendo, it's a sudden horn blast interrupting the quiet. The build up to this consists of several old photographs, ambiguously shown. In no way is it indicated to the audience that, a Oberhauser is prone to sudden outbursts, b Oberhauser is insecure on the contrary, he appears supremely confident in himself , c Bond had a sad childhood other than the obvious sadness of losing parents , d that Oberhauser has any connection to the cuckoo imagery other than it being a convenient metaphor. Perhaps it is suggested by his general detachment, but if he really is detached, then why care about Bond especially? In sum, it comes out of the blue. Secondly, the scene itself is serene. There's some feeling for Bond, who is being tortured, and Madeline Swann, who is watching, but Oberhauser's sentiments seem to be derived from curiosity more than anything. The emotional power of the scene comes from the Bond Swann dynamic, it doesn't really emanate from Oberhauser. It's credible that Oberhauser would torture Bond using gadgetry, but I don't think it's credible that Oberhauser has a special relationship with Bond, judging from the revealing scene itself. Thirdly, there is no real aftermath from this. We can reasonably assess Bond as being hurt by his adopted father's death, but this is speculation on the audience's part. Subsequently, Bond doesn't seem to be motivated by revenge, as in Quantum of Solace, but rather by a general ambition to do good by stopping Spectre and protecting Swann. Oberhauser doesn't dwell on it much either, after the fact, even though its pivotal to the plot. As far we can plumb Oberhauser's explicit motivations, they seem to be predicated on him being a visionary , in contrast to the implicit motivations undergirding his actions, which orbit his alleged animosity to Bond. I think that the Bond Oberhauser feud approach could have worked. With better framing, and a more intimate bond between the two, it could have been moving. This could have been accomplished by invoking a genuine rift between Oberhauser and Bond, rather than one which is clearly Oberhauser's fault. E.g. Bond, Oberhauser, and Oberhauser's sister are hiking. Oberhauser's sister falls into frozen water. Bond and Oberhauser try to rescue her. They fail, and Oberhauser blames Bond. Alternatively, Bond contributes to the problem, e.g. Bond is a troubled boy because he's an orphan, and he does something to provoke Oberhauser's father, such as kill their family dog. Oberhauser's father sends Bond away, Oberhauser is angry with his father for sending away Bond, who he has embraced as a brother, and he kills his father. Also, as noted, with the crucial addition of a better build up. As things stand, Oberhauser is a contradictory character, who is simultaneously dispassionate and vengeful, lofty and personal, supranational and intimate. When Bond is captured, a suspect motivation is ignominiously injected into Oberhauser, and the character never recovers from this spontaneous nadir. That's why, when Bond defeats Oberhauser, there isn't anything meaningful to say. Bond makes a remark which is purely about his own journey, and doesn't reflect his battle with Oberhauser, as there's nothing coherent to reflect. In conclusion, Oberhauser is a weak villain.

Teams kick to the opposite end in each new quarter. The clock only runs during play, and quarters usually end up around 30 minutes in real time. However, one of the quirks of the game is that the time is kept by officials way up in the grandstand, and the players out on the field don\u2019t have an official countdown clock to consult during play. There is a countdown clock on the TV feed, but while there is an upward counting timer on each ground\u2019s scoreboard, players are largely left to their own devices to manage the late stages of the game. gt Each team has 18 players on the field, plus four on the interchange bench.

The US is a poor ally for the Kurds. They armed them and helped them, but only against IS because the Kurds abandoned oilfields of American companies in Northern Iraq. This forced Obama to intervene. But US has too much at stakes within Turkey airfields, nuclear weapon storages to effectively offer the Kurds any political support beyond weapons and airstrikes. They already are withdrawing support to Syrian Kurds after the Turkish Kurds broke the truce with Erdogan. Russians have bombed ISIS and the rebels, but haven't bombed the Kurds yet, and the Kurds and the regime, while not working together, have not been in open conflict. After the regime ran out of Hakasah, and IS took the former regime bases, the Kurds retook it, and the regime let them. They even had shared borders, and border patrols standing across each other warily, but no open conflict. Sometimes, they will even let them cross each other's territory to resupply move troops, etc. Source The Kurds don't also explicitily demand the removal of Assad. All they want is more autonomy and their own region. Both the regime and the Kurds fight IS. The Free Syrian Army has also allied itself with Is and Al Nusrah before against the Kurds, but IS turned on both, and drove them out. This makes for hostility between the Free Syrian Army and the Kurds, so a rebel Kurd alliance is unlikely. Rather, Russian diplomats will negotiate with the Kurds. In the following weeks, we will hear that Russians communicate with Kurds in context of airstrikes, etc. Russian special forces will, alongside with the US and the British who have vowed to send special OPS recently , assist the Kurds when they attack ISIS, alongside with airstrikes and materials given. Having the Kurds as an ally would expand Russian influence in the region significantly and Kurds are historically and ideologically friendly to Russia. Many Kurds are pro communism, and left in general. Military, first a map. the Kurds could push hard to the south to besiege Raqqah and cut off supplylines to Aleppo. Or the Kurds would simultaneously push West towards Aleppo or East from their little pocket to the North East , while the Regime would push North to Idlib and from there to Aleppo. The Kurds get Aleppo and Raqqa, while the regime pushes east. Kurds will pressure from the North, while the regime moves West. In Iraq, Iraqi Kurds could push South to further pressure IS. However, Iraqi Kurds and Syrian Kurds are not as close as the Syrian Kurds and the Turkish Kurds. This is important later on. Now, as for the population this is tricky. Some analysists say that moderate Sunii are not eager to support the Kurds, but rather to support IS instead who are Sunii However, I feel that most Sunii Syrians support the regime most of all, and support stability over all now. If Kurds would ally with the regime, and the Kurds could provide a stable enviroment and provide what the Syrian Sunii need, the Sunii would accept this. ISIS' barbaric acts made for their loss of support from moderate muslims. This will be vital. However, not all the local Arabic tribes will peacefully cooperate with Kurds. Unfortunetly, ethnic cleansings will might happen. After ISIS is largely driven back, a deal will be struck with the Kurds between the regime and the Kurds. In return for support, the Kurds will receive a region with greater autonomous rights in the North of Syria. Perhaps not all they gained would be allowed for them to keep, but still. Especially Russia would negotiate this with the regime and the Kurds, since if they have Kurdish support, they would have significant influence in the region to counteract Israel and to the North, Turkey. Now, even if Assad would be deposed Russians have recently changed stance to claim they never insisted on Assad staying in power , they'd have an ally. Most likely, we'd see a new puppet democracy where for example the Kurds would have a determined number of seats in Parliament, allowing them to block new legislation if this displeases the Russians or themselves. However, because the Syrian and Iraqi Kurds have certain problems, they will not go together to make a great Kurdistan, I feel, for now.

If only caught after the game, they should be suspended, fined or otherwise disciplined. If caught during the game, they should also instantly be instantly awarded a red card.

There are only so many people who can succeed in the entertainment field singers, athletics, etc. What makes one think he she can succeed in those fields?

This led to the interim government sealing and searching the town. They were unable to find insurgents and hostages. The public finds such cases interesting and colorful.

It seems the most contemptible and pathetic aspect of our discourse is our reliance on euphemism. It is hard not to sneer at the duplicity and cringing cowardice inherent in the self bestowed titles of various political movements, like the pro lifers or pro choicers . Say what you mean respectively, you're against abortion and women's ability to abort. Conversely, the latter are for the availability of abortion. When you resort to calling yourself a pro lifer , for example, you by implication endorse beliefs within the remit of being pro life which you don't necessarily support. Pro lifers tend not to care how many brown children are bisected by apache fire in the middle east, nor do they tend to oppose the death penalty. But the pro choicers don't get off either, because their chosen name implies all sorts of positions related to bodily autonomy that choicers do not necessarily endorse, like the right to use any sort of drug, the right to terminate the biological functioning of one's own body suicide etc. etc. We perhaps ought to be softer on this side of the debate, as these are positions that choicers are more inclined than others to support. Nevertheless, there is something about the euphemistic titling of social movements centred on a single issue that retards our discourse and devalues the concepts they appropriate to their purpose, adopting whatever term they like when it becomes politically expedient and dropping it whenever it ceases to be so.

Locking your house is fine. They're objects, not people. It doesn't impose negative views on a gender.

I mean no insult to anyone so please don't insult me. Edit 4 There's been a really great discussion on street harassment in the comments. That's a really big issue but that wasn't originally what I was intending to talk about. When I spoke with my friends about this, they expressed concern for themselves, and being actually hurt, which is what promoted me to go through murder and rape statistics since they were concerned that they didn't know what guys would due to them if they walked around alone. Do you guys view the idea of being fearful of random men hurting you as you walk to go shopping, wrong? Edit 5 Ok, just to be super clear, I am not suggesting that women change their actions. I don't have a solution to street harassment, which is a huge issue, but that doesn't mean this isn't wrong. Hopefully we can discuss things, come to an understanding and maybe find an even better solution. For now, it may be like a necessary but unfortunately slightly wrong solution. Edit 6 Thank you to everyone who replied. I've enjoyed talking to almost all you and I appreciate all the input you have given me. My view has not yet changed. My view is that assuming that men would do negative things towards you, like harass you, solely based on their gender and avoiding them, is wrong. I think it may be necessary to do so since I don't know of a better way to counter street harassment, but that doesn't mean it's right. I'm not asking people to stop avoiding, just to acknowledge that the view it gives on men is a wrong one, one that assumes that men you meet might hurt you. People will still use this view for safety. I think it's a very low level of sexism. Just because someone is male, doesn't mean that it's right to assume that they would harass you. Just because groups of guys do doesn't mean the next guy will. He's a completely separate person. It's not right to assume negative things about people based on their gender. I was born male, that's it. I haven't done anything wrong, I've hurt no one, and yet regardless of my actions, I will be seen as a threat. I don't even have to attempt to interact with someone, it's just assumed. It's not right that interactions with groups of people are applied to their entire gender or race. Meeting a new group of that gender or race should not warrant the same opinions. These are completely separate individuals. They have done nothing to deserve being grouped with the people who do harm. I think of this all as a necessary but wrong sort of situation , but this isn't what I originally intended to talk about in my . I spoke with my friends about this and they all mentioned fear of being assaulted. I am heavily against the view that men are murders, or that it's okay to think that men might kill you. If you want to keep commenting, I would suggest that your points be directed towards these two posts I completely disagree with these two posts. It is not okay to compare men to loaded guns, it is absolutely dehumanizing, and it is not okay to think that men around you might kill you. I am my own person. I do as much good as I can, and I hope to help tons of people through my life, yet with all of that, people will still fear that I might kill them, or rape all because of how I was born. That is not right I really don't get how it's okay for someone to fear me because I might kill them. It hurts so much that I will always be viewed like this. I want to help people. My gender shouldn't matter. I shouldn't be assumed to be a potential murderer or rapist. That's not right. No matter what I do, people will always assume first that I'm a murderer. I shouldn't have to prove to people that I won't kill them. I don't get why people think this is okay. I think that the idea that any man you might might meet could be a murder is damaging. If you want to change my view, you would have to convince me to agree with those two posts. Edit 7 To be even more clear. I think it may be necessary, but wrong, to avoid people for safety but do you not think it's wrong to assume that people are murderers and rapists? Do you not think it's wrong that your husband or son or best friend will always be assumed as a potential rapist, no matter how good you know them to be, other people will always assume that for their entire life just because they are male. Hi, This is my first  so sorry if I mess up I also made a throwaway since I wasn't sure of the response to this question . I've experienced in my life and seen in multiple subreddits or Askreddits I can list if desired an acceptable fear of men overall due to the actions of a small few. The idea that men around you might murder, rape, assault or rob you because murders, rapes, assaults and robberies are done predominantly by men. I think that this view is wrong since the majority of men, like any person, do not commit crime. To start, I'll show that a tiny fraction of men commit crimes. Since I am from the US, I went to the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting site and US Census Bureau for my data which I will link. To make things simpler, I made the following assumptions All the charges listed resulted in convictions, every charge represents a crime that was committed All the charges listed are done by separate people, no person does a crime multiple times According to the FBI, in 2015 there were 5,603,363 men arrested for crimes. These crimes include drunkenness, disorderly conduct, drug abuse, DUI, so I will focus on the murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, since to my understanding, these are the large contributors to the acceptable fear of men that I disagree with. In 2015, there were 6,639 arrests for murder and non negligent manslaughter, 15,453 arrests for rape, 56,502 arrests for robbery and 208,893 arrests for aggravated assault Source According to the US Census Bureau, in 2015 there were 158,229,297 men in the US. Source, put year to July 1, 2015 and sex to Male So, taking the arrests for men and the total male population in the US, you get that 0.004 of men murder, 0.010 of men rape, 0.036 of men rob, and 0.132 of men assault. A fear of all men doing these things wrongly assumes fault on the 99 99.99 of men who do not . Even if you take all the arrests in men of 2015 which include non violent offense like fraud, vandalism, liquor laws, drunkenness, drug abuse you only get 3.54 or 96 of the male population does absolutely nothing legally wrong, violent or not. I would compare this to holding negative views towards black people because of the high crime rates. According to the FBI, in 2015 there were 4,343 black people both male and female arrested for murder and non negligent manslaughter, 4,907 arrests for rape, 39,052 arrests for robbery and 92,237 arrests for aggravated assault Source According to the US Census Bureau, in 2015 there were 42,632,530 black people in the US Source, out year to July 1, 2015 and sex to Both So, taking the arrests for black people and the total black population in the US, you get that 0.01 of black people murder, 0.012 of black people rape, 0.092 of black people rob and 0.216 of black people assault, which is all higher than the solely male statistics. I may be looking at this from an incorrect perspective, so please help me understand why I'm wrong. I am black and I don't think it's right for people to view me as threatening or worry that I might assault them due to my race. Likewise, I don't think it's right for me to be viewed as a potential rapist, murderer, thief, etc because I am male. It is an insanely tiny fraction of the population that does this. I am my own person. I am not responsible for the actions for people that I have no influence over. It's not right for me to share some sense of blame for other men. I'm just me, a single male. I haven't done anything. I don't rape, murder, rob or assault anyone, and yet regardless of my actions, there is this fear of me, that I could do this. I've read through a bunch of posts mentioning being fearful of leaving the house, or walking down the street because every male could do these things and changing streets to avoid being on the same side as a man. I do it too. I get worried that I might not be far away enough from people, that perhaps I'm scaring the person in front of me because we happen to be walking in the same directing. That I could be threatening, but I don't want to think of myself as a threat because I haven't done anything besides be male and black. I wouldn't tolerate people telling me that they're scared black people would murder them at night and so they do there best to avoid them, so I don't feel like it should be done to males either. I get that people want to be cautious, but are our fears going to be weighted more towards black men to be even more safe? So people would be able to say that they avoid black people just in case? Isn't it wrong to think negatively of people based on their gender or race? I don't think it's right that the guy walking in front of you or behind you or on the opposite side of the street might rape you, like its not right to think that someone would do it solely for them being black. Now, there are threats out there, but I don't believe those should take away your view of the average person or male. If a group of guys are staring at you while blocking the sidewalk, warranted fear, or if a guy wearing gang colors or hand gestures, then sure, but the sole fact that someone male shouldn't be threatening. I get being caution but I just think that it is just so wrong to apply to all black people or men. To my understanding, this view is held by a good portion of people, including my friends, and I think its wrong, but maybe I'm wrong, and there's just something I can't see. On a brighter note, violent crime has been decreasing consistently over the past 20 years and its great to look at the numbers Source Unfortunately, the arrests for rape have been increasing, but I hope that is due more to more rapist getting caught than just an increase in rapes.

A more detailed explanation Now I like the separation after elementary school and I think it even should get separated even more maybe inside the school, to put good and no so good in one class . Teacher usually try to help the weakest link in the class and as bigger the difference between the weakest and the strongest is, as more problems will the good students have, because the class gets boring and he won't learn as much. A lot of people even want to generalize the classes even more. Without a separation after year 4, so that students will stay together even longer without a separation by skill.

The knowledge that one is avoiding such misfortunes while others must suffer through them creates the sensation of happiness. Bearing this in mind, it is only logical that happiness cannot exist without sadness. I think this notion applies to any scale of human life No one is truly happy unless they have been exposed to or experience misfortune. This leads me to believe that there will always have to be someone who is sad for there to be someone who is happy. Points of contention Happiness is simply the result of the avoidance or overcoming of misfortune. In order for happiness to exist, there must be sadness. Therefore, there must always be sad people for anyone to be happy. I would like to discuss this topic because it seems very pessimistic in my mind.

If human beings were valuable in that way, then they would not be per se valuable, but only the states or properties that they bore or carried would be of per se value. Or, secondly, a thing might be valuable because it is per se valuable, that is, it is valuable for its own sake, and not as a means toward what it enables to be instantiated. But, human beings must be valuable in the second way rather than in the first way. For if they were valuable only as mere vehicles for what is per se valuable, then it would always be morally right to kill one child, provided one agreed to replace him with two others. No human beings would have more than replaceable value. None would have the kind of value that almost all of us recognize that at least some human beings do have.

But, by calling actions or traits 'manly' or 'womanly' seems alienating and demeaning to both women and men. It also seems to further divide the genders based on an arbitrary set of properties If a woman was to fix a car, for example, would she be a 'manly woman'? If a man were to like sewing or fashion, would he be a 'womanly man'? At what point does the line break down and the gender role grouping of interests just become 'what some person said'? This also makes some pretty disturbing suggestions. Such as androgyny or femininity being something to be expunged. Or that having traits outside of what is 'manly' is undesirable and a sign of weakness, cowardice, or naivety. This seems pretty insulting to women by definition are linked directly to the term femininity and even to men. If a androgynous or effeminate man was content with how they were, it seems like these sites suggest that he is still wrong because it's not 'manly'. I feel that calling it out is is not helpful, but rather indirectly encourages prejudice and alienation towards that person for not matching up to the arbitrary definition of 'manliness' In group favoritism Likewise, if a woman were to possess a 'manly' attribute, or even a traditionally 'manly' leadership role, it will automatically seem out of place because of that label same as above. I'm not a feminist, SJW, or any of that. I'm not doubting for a second that there are large, biological and psychological differences between men and women. I think there is always going to be some kind of a divide.

My habit is to write out all the nuances I have in mind upfront. Hopefully I delineated my sections well enough to assist in skipping to the sub argument you might be most interested in. The TL DR is contained in the BOLDED CAPS section headings . I've been frustrated that the debate about gun control with gun rights advocates GRA often stumbles into this dead end gt Me guns kill a lot of people gt GRA yea, but you'll be glad when we have those guns when the government tries to put us in camps. gt Me how exactly do our guns stop that? gt GRA something something Hitler took guns from jews. This  aims for an intelligent discussion of that last question. Many gun rights advocates casually claim widespread gun ownership is good and necessary to give the populace a fighting chance in stopping or overthrowing an overreaching state. But where's the evidence that guns in the hands of the public will aid such a venture? I know it's a superficially appealing idea but it doesn't pass serious scrutiny, some of which I lay out below. This is an important question . If we're to take the premise of defenders of gun rights seriously, the cost of wrongful gun deaths today is partially offset by the benefit of stopping hypothetical acts of tyranny that our guns afford us. But there's no examination of the assumptions behind that alleged benefit. If we're serious about the threat of an overreaching government we should soberly weigh whether possessing stockpiles of weapons will actually help or hinder the effort to stop it. I have not seen a good argument that it will help, and all the accessible evidence seems to point towards hindrance. Evidence such as MIDDLE EASTERN REVOLUTIONS SUCCEED WHEN UNARMED In recent years we've seen four major revolutions break out under middle east regimes. Two of them in Tunisia and Egypt were overwhelmingly unarmed revolutions. They each succeeded in less than a month and with relatively few casualties about 0.02 and 0.01 of the population were killed or injured in Tunisia and Egypt, respectively. The other two revolutions in Libya and Syria were and are heavily armed. The Libyan revolution took eight months to succeed and killed or injured about 1.2 of its population. It may well have failed without outside intervention. The Syrian revolution has been raging for nearly 3 years and appears on the brink of failure. Something like 0.5 of its population has been killed no estimate available on the injured, but extrapolating from the other killed injured ratios it's something in the range of 1.5 3.0 total killed injured . That amounts to about 60 300 times the casualties of the other two revolutions, and it's still climbing. Restricting attention to deaths month or deaths injuries month the armed revolutions are still an order of magnitude bloodier than the unarmed ones. It's not hard to see why. In Egypt and Tunisia there was a popular, unarmed uprising demanding the regimes step down. There's no viable political response to a popular demand made by unarmed masses . Both countries' security forces fired on the unarmed protesters and it only rallied their populations further behind the protesters. There was no alternative left but step down or get further pummeled in the eyes of the world and your people as your small domestic base of support crumbles and you must step down in worst conditions. But in Libya and Syria there was a political alternative because the protesters were armed and easily portrayed as a threat requiring the full force of the government to combat. In the name of protecting the people, of course. The countries were are divided between regime loyalists and opponents. So long as there's two sides shooting at each other an average citizen can make a fair argument for siding with either, and their sentiment will tend to follow which side is acting most unjustly. Correlation is not causation but here it should give us pause . Why, precisely, do so many blithely assert that maximal second amendment rights will increase the likelihood of halting an oppressive government counter to the most obvious recent evidence? HISTORICAL ATROCITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH MORE GUNS Let's do a thought experiment. There are episodes of US history that we look back on with shame. Episodes frequently deployed to argue the prospect of tyranny in the US is not as far fetched as some think. Slavery, internment of Japanese citizens, segregation, and others. All these involved what may be fairly called an egregious but legally sanctioned violation of rights. Suppose you could take a time machine back to whenever you wanted and could arm whoever you wanted with as many small arms as you wished within reason, and in a way in which everyone knows about the existence of arms. We can't use our time machine to mount a surprise attack . Would doing so in any of these historical episodes do anything except make the situation worse for those whose rights were violated? For instance, what would have happened if some WWII era Japanese citizens violently resisted efforts to detain them? It would have been harder for authorities to detain them, for sure, but the reason there was a political impetus to interning Japanese citizens was their perceived threat to the homeland which we're now playing into. You can't separate the unjust act from the rationale for it. It would harder to detain the armed Japanese, and in response the government would send overwhelming force to kill or detain them. At that point it's not about a firefight with some holdouts, it's about a show of force to set a proper example in wartime. If some Japanese Americans violently resisted they'd likely be killed, the national security rationale for detaining them is vindicated, any hope for a legal challenge against internment would suffer a serious setback, and today we'd have more defenders of the internment because of the violent incidents that broke out. How about the civil rights movement. Does anyone think MLK wouldn't be considered an even more dangerous radical if he was holding a rifle during I have a Dream ? That if black students brought guns with them to sit ins their political cause wouldn't have been dead in the water? Does anyone believe that any of these shameful episodes of our history could have been rectified with the introduction of weapons in the hands of those oppressed, to use against their oppressors? If not, why does anyone think using guns to guard against the next overreach will play out any better? Are my examples too selective? Are there any historical episodes of oppression anywhere in the world in which giving the oppressed guns against reasonably armed oppressors don't go back to the stone age would have changed the outcome in their favor? Battlefields don't count. REVOLUTION IS POLITICS, NOT WARFARE A revolution against ones government is a fundamentally political battle fought by whatever means are politically expedient to each side. Firearms are a symbol in that political battle. Brandishing them implies hostile intent, even when you proclaim you're merely defending yourself. Suppose the US government is seizing the first born child of every family to forcibly draft them into some war, or something substitute your alternate vision of tyranny, it doesn't matter . You publicly say you'll use your gun to prevent government forces entering your property to take your first born. You proclaim this is merely a defensive action against unjust violations of fundamental rights. What will happen? What gun rights advocates seem to forget is the political context in which these events occur. How we got to this point as a society is important to how your resistance will be interpreted. Here the broader context necessarily involves a significant portion of the country thinking government seizure of first born children is a good thing. There are supporters of this plan, there are those who are unsure what to think, there are opponents to the seize children plan who renounce violence, and then there's you. Already there's worry about people like you employing terrorist tactics in a policy controversy. Pundits and media personalities of a certain ideology aligning with the government's already have a dismissive label for people like you. Perhaps motherbirds . Already there's a public debate about how much force the government should use against those pesky gun toting motherbirds who don't go along with the Grand Project of taking first born children. Declaring you will shoot government forces walking onto your property validates the hardliners who argue the government should take all precautions necessary when they come to take the first born of those nutty motherbirds. Anything less on the part of the government would demonstrate a lack of resolve to blah blah blah. You with your gun aren't the only one angling for the symbolism. The government has a commitment to a controversial policy to exercise, and your resistance makes for a great opportunity to showcase that commitment. If you want to stand up for your principles against all other considerations, you'll get in a firefight with government forces who are likely anticipating it which you'll inevitably lose. The firefight will get big media coverage and millions of homes see footage of local law enforcement taking fire and possibly getting killed for carrying out a law order that a significant portion of the country thinks is a good thing, like the aerial images we see on the news of swat teams gathering outside the scene of some nutcase with a gun. Even those on the fence on the broader issue will think the law enforcement didn't deserve to be shot at and they marginally move away from your position because you just associated your position with needless violence. Everyone who is on your side of the underlying issue now has to prologue every public statement with a condemnation of the violent actions of people like you, distancing themselves for fear of being perpetually associated with anti government freaks when they press their case. You and your cause are better off resisting non violently in some way, or hiding, or fleeing the country, or something else . Regardless of whatever message you think you send with your sacrifice on behalf of your principles, the political situation has already gotten to the point where society and the media has long ago decided what your decision to use violence to defend yourself says about you and the legitimacy of your position. In much the same way that Timothy McVeigh's act of violence completely renders him a right wing nutcase rather than leading into a discussion of the merits his legitimate grievance with the government. In much the same way pro life extremists who bomb abortion clinics are dangerous domestic terrorists much more than they have an important political point. In much the same way Ted Kaczynski's creative use of the postal system is a bigger story than the concerns about industrialized society that motivated him. In much the same way it's difficult to have a reasonable discussion about whether the US ought to continue to have military bases in the middle east when one side of that question can easily, and unfairly, be dismissed as Al Qaeda sympathizers. Using or threatening violence simply imperils your political cause . Not just for you, but everyone else who shares your political goals. And it's the political cause and public sentiment that's at stake when we're up against a government on the threshold of tyranny. In contrast, gun rights advocates sound as if they think a revolution against their government entails all out warfare between two teams, with zero fence sitters, won by whoever has the superior hardware and tactics I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here some gun rights advocates really sound like their optimal outcome is getting mowed down in a blaze of glory fighting jack booted fascists, or something . When has this ever been an appropriate model of how a revolution played out? A revolution is not warfare, it's political stagecraft, portraying oneself to a vacillating audience as the innocent victim of a malicious, bloodthirsty enemy we all need to unite against. Carrying a weapon, let alone proudly beating your chest about carrying a weapon that you've long claimed is for fighting the government , severely undermines that political message. Look at a detailed account of how the battles of Lexington and Concord that spurred the American Revolution played out It's a remarkably hesitant procession of events, each side trying to avoid provoking the other, orders to only fire if fired upon, the British being excessively polite to the locals, etc. The colonists won the battles not when they literally took place, but when they won the subsequent spin war, domestically and in the London press, about what had happened. That spin wasn't that of a military victory, but that the British were bloodthirsty oppressors slaughtering colonists. The ultimate purpose was not the battlefield victory but the political messaging that could be built around it to support the war for independence gt It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war. The history of Patriot preparations, intelligence, warning signals, and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades. The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge, hors de combat, struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet, the purported scalping , was strongly suppressed. Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants this notably happened to Paul Revere . Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter . This political messaging would have been further strengthened if the slaughtered colonists were unarmed and no redcoats were killed. Their guns were damaging to the cause, if anything. A common response is that gun rights work as a deterrent to tyranny rather than a guard against it. This contention is disturbingly unfalsifiable and I'm skeptical because it's usually uttered with as little thought or evidence as the claim guns will stop tyranny. But we can still poke some holes Those who make the decisions about policy politicians are not the ones on the front lines of an armed and hostile populace, so the value of this deterrence is dubious. We've all seen in our lifetimes majorities of our politicians willing to unleash martial law, so to speak, in other countries, and that's while knowing our armed forces will meet violent resistance. Why would they hesitate to do the same domestically merely because the population has guns? Think of an amoral politician who knows that his bill or policy will spark violent opposition, in some form or another. He thinks it's a good idea regardless. What, exactly, is stopping him? If his bill goes through and causes violent attacks on authorities, that politician will receive the backlash? That doesn't comport with the reality we've seen in America. Violence used against the government rallies support the government. The politician will have an opportunity to give a righteous speech about not backing down in the face of terror, garner more support for his bill policy, and marginalize political opponents further by their association with violent tactics. If the politician has the foresight to understand this, the possible violence backlash is an incentive to going forward. Remember when liberal media organizations were running full coverage of any hint of violence breaking out or threatened at tea party rallies, and conservatives did the same for occupy wall street? Violence and threat of violence are gleefully held up by the political opposition to smear an entire group of people. The prospect of violence unleashed on local law enforcement by your political opponents is no kind of deterrent at all. Under this deterrence theory, what keeps tyranny at bay in all the industrialized democracies of the world with much lower rates of gun ownership? Does anyone think France, Australia, or Japan is creeping towards totalitarianism? Does anyone think they're more likely to move towards totalitarianism than the US? Is there something about the US that makes it uniquely susceptible to tyranny? Please disabuse me of my ignorance. If not tonight, I'll be back to answer comments within 24 hours.

I think that it\u2019s awful what people do. I\u2019ve heard people say that, it\u2019s okay for someone to abort a child any point it\u2019s in the womb. If it\u2019s in the womb, you still have a choice to kill it. A literal day before it\u2019s born, people say it would be fine to kill it. Babies are born weeks before there due date aka they can survive outside the womb earlier than 9 months. So if the baby can survive outside the womb at that point how is it okay for people to say do you can abort it. That is straight up murder, explain to me how it is not, it will be able to function if you took it out the womb. Life starts at conception 100 the bundle of cells counts as life. If those exact same bundle of cells were found mars tomorrow, people will be screaming life on mars. So why does it differ here? In many places if you kill a pregnant lady, it counts as 2 accounts of murder. But people can abort the baby and it\u2019s fine ? Whaaaat Have we gone crazy As for the raped person question. I do feel deeply pained for this person, you have been violated and I wish it never happened, but to claim it\u2019s your body, your choice, the same way you have been violated and hurt. Is the same way you are hurting the foetus inside you. You don\u2019t control their body so why do you have a choice over there\u2019s. 2 wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Let that life, develop, allow for it to be put up for adoption. Adoption is sad for children I think, but at least they have a life to live and try to flourish in. Adoption is a better alternative to death. I found an amazing case of this guy who was a failed abortion attempt but was still born completely fine he was given to an orphanage at a young age, he became a really successful person in his field don\u2019t remember exactly what it was but he was given a chance to live and he was doing exceptionally well for himself.

When there the cars stop there, it's only for pedestrians to cross, not also cars to go the other way. These sidewalks are usually button controller, but I've found that after pushing the button on one, it takes 2 3 minutes for the cars' light to actually turn yellow then red. There is absolutely no need for this wait. The yellow light gives cars enough warning time to slow down before the red. And if the light doesn't turn red sooner it will just turn red later, so there you aren't causing the cars to wait any less by waiting. You're just causing the pedestrians to wait more. The one exception I can think of is if the traffic has already been stopped very recently within the past couple minutes , it's reasonable to have pedestrians wait a little bit more so that cars on that road don't have to be too frequently stopped.

If they wouldn't say something under oath in a court, they shouldn't say it on cable TV. I'd like to make some clarifying points If a candidate says, I will bring lots of jobs back. This will be interpreted as, I will TRY to bring lots of jobs back. If the candidate makes any proveable attempts to bring back jobs, even if ineffective, the candidate did not lie. If they did not make an attempt, they lied and should be subject to fines or jail time. Hyperbole should be considered lying and perjury. Determining hyperbole and exaggeration can be tricky. It's a rhetorical device, but it's a rhetorical device centered on emotional appeals and not logic or facts. Yes it makes their jobs harder. Too bad. That's the price of power. But I'm not solid on this and could be argued away from this. The first amendment protects speech unless it causes harm. I can say, f ck you but not I will murder you. I can say fire but shout it in a crowded room and cause a riot. When elected officials speak, they are speaking FOR the government, and not as private individuals. Even when they try to voice personal opinions, they are treated as official stances. If a Senator tweets, abortion is murder they are in a position to make it law. They are inherently magnified by the press and amount of coverage and should thus be held to a higher standard. And false statements made by elected officials should be considered sworn testimony. If they wouldn't say it under oath in court, they shouldn't say it. Speech by elected officials carry power and the harm that false statements made should be considered as much. Likewise, the moment someone announces candidacy for an elected position the public should be able to make a decision based on facts. Otherwise, it's election fraud. A private citizen can slander a candidate by saying Candidate A fornicates with goats. But the moment Candidate B says the same statement it should be subject to fines and criminal prosecution. The harm caused by electing the wrong official is real and serious.

Even if you could ensure the person you are trading votes with does what they say they will, which you cannot, I just see this as a total slap in the face of democracy. You are essentially taking the power from some states. If a state's natural voting outcome is to give its electoral college votes to Trump then that is what should happen. If this happens because third party candidates are popular in that state then so be it.

I believe the argument that no federal money goes towards this aspect of the organisation is flawed, because while Planned Parenthood has to solicit other funds to do this work, it is less than the amount they would have if they had no federal funding, meaning the practice is still made easier by the federal funding. It is easier for Planned Parenthood to continue performing abortions, because the government has helped alleviate the cost of other aspects of the organisation's work. While I disagree with the ethical position, I believe that the consequenc is clear if politicians truly want to not fund organisations that perform abortions, they can't just promise that no funds will go to that specific practice, because money doesn't work like that, keeping the lights on and the machines running doesn't work like that, salaries don't work like that.

Old people swear its 10 , and I\u2019m sure every server has their own opinionated feelings on the matter. Just raise all the food prices up instead, I would prefer it. At least then I am explicitly told ahead of time how much I need to pay to be a \u2018good person.\u2019 However, servers themselves don\u2019t want to raise food prices in lieu of tips because they love the tipping system.

If you go over to r talesfromyourserver, there argument against raising food prices is that you\u2019ll still end up paying the same.

While this might be true, I'm pretty positive that such speculation doesn't take into consideration that as time advances, our capacity to sustain ourselves will also increase, so it's really up to speculation. We won't become immortal, and we won't be able to extend our lives forever. But, between living 80 years and spend 10 years in pain physical pain from weakening, and emotional pain from dying friends and relatives and living a healthy 150 years or more, I would definitively choose the latter.

Drugs are good*", "id": 121686, "argument": "title only for ''wtf is this guy thinking'' purposes, read post before reflecting. Religion, tradition, culture are different slices of the same pie. Religion has been defined as a system of beliefs based on humanity's attempt to explain the universe and natural phenomena, often involving one or more deities or other supernatural forces and also requiring or binding adherents to follow prescribed religious obligations Culture has been defined as the system of shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors and artifacts that the members of society use to cope with their world and with one another, and that are transmitted from generation to generation through learning. Cultural appropriation is the adoption of some specific elements of one culture by a different cultural group. It describes acculturation or assimilation, but can imply a negative view towards acculturation from a minority culture by a dominant culture. It can include the introduction of forms of dress or personal adornment, music and art, religion, language, or social behavior. These elements, once removed from their indigenous cultural contexts, can take on meanings that are significantly divergent from, or merely less nuanced than, those they originally held. Appropriation practice involves the 'appropriation' of ideas, symbols, artifacts, image, sound, objects, forms or styles from other cultures, from art history, from popular culture or other aspects of man made visual or non visual culture. Religion and culture are by definition based on something that promote ''mental psychological fallacies'' and ''mini me syndrome''. While also giving authoritarian fallacy a luxury display board. Empowering the whole idea that having authority makes you creditable. There is a lot more, but the thing is promoting ignorance.

Thousands of years in human history people have used local plants to dissolve cultural and psychological bridges. In a metaphoric way they were are exchanging their cultural driving seat for something else. Something not tied to anything else besides one substance meeting another substance. When your mind is affected by a ''natural'' substance, whether it be dimethyltryptamine or psilocybin people often think ''normal brain chemistry working different''. But what is normal? I could give ridiculous amounts of examples to illustrate this point but the post is long enough as it is. These substances are not tied to a particular ideology or tradition culture. As it is an personal experience. Tripping on these specific substances is a journey trough self. Subconscious and ''repressed data'' is often represented to the user. The user has a ''feeling of connectivity with the rest of the universe''. This is linked by scientist as possible treatment for people with PTSD or general depression. A lot of users also go trough an ego death kinda the opposite of cocaine, banksters anyone? . Other effects include but not limited to ''Better personality'' ''Grows new braincells'' Imagine the possibilities. As the ego of the man drives him to do immoral things, thinking he is doing something good. Or thinking he is entitled to it. Ego is ''source of racism'' in a way, thinking you are more superior.

Well we can cut some corners by limiting intelligence to mathematical abilities, abstract problem solving, ability to see patterns and connect things. By doing this we can leave nonsense like you can be bad at Q but excel in T out of the equation. Why this? Let me give you an analogy If you can breakdance and you can't drive a car, you still can't drive a car. You can bust the littest moves out there but it doesn't change the fact at all that you can't drive a car, which is really problematic if you going to be a driver and you have always wanted to be one. Does this mean that you can't never drive a car? Maybe, maybe not. That depends on few things, but if after long period of practise you still suck at it, there's a good chance that's it's an indicator about your limits i.e that you will never be a good driver hell there's a chance that you will never be even an mediocore one. Well just replace driving with math and physics, and driver by engineer to get my situation. Always wanted to be an engineer, but now after practising with the more harder entrance exam questions I'm currently about to apply for and ENG school , I'm starting to have serious self doubt, because if the brightest people in my country are having a tough time at the school I'm trying to get into what does it mean to a guy like me who has 0 gifts for ENG subjects. I may have somewhat good work ethic and get 80 95 score from the test long story short It's meant to assort people with hard questions, so not everyone can get in , but I know that I just lack the intelligence that gifted people have. How come? Even after 9 tormenting month of studying my success rate is around 40 in practise problems. This means that only 4 10 I get the right result without no one's help i.e only 4 10 I actually understad the subject well enough to apply it. This maybe ok in the start, but when the total work hours are closing to 2000, I'm starting to feel that intelligence is greater factor than determination. Hard work maybe admirable, but with intelligence you will always be more skilled, and more importantly your thinking will be in a higher level. I mean with higher level that there is a limit for how effective your thinking can be. People like Stephen Hawking, Terrence Tao or Elon Musk are clearly higher than what the average people can ever achieve. Sidenote Please don't waste you time by telling me that I just haven't been practising properly, that the flashcards which I've done don't seve any good which is wierd because I haven't done any flashcards because it would be a waste of time and that I just need to find the proper way by brain can process information . When in reality I've tried many different study methods in various places which include but are not limited to pomodoro technique, feynman technique and cornell notes and have got an tutoring for months from really experienced people. Okay so how if you don't seem to make it, you seem to make it according to you test score ? Easy With enough repetition even a monkey could drive a car assuming it don't die in the process of learning . So I just hammer enough questions are remember what to do in the test. But that is missing the main point, which is that assingments determine one's intelligence . IMO you can do good , but you will never do as well as someone who is gifted. My evidence for this is that a classmate we can call him A I had never did anyhing regarding math and physics besides listening in class. You may just say that it's called 'paying attention' but that would be just rubbish. A never even bothered to read the course material as it was just so easy for him. He seemed honestly surprised when I told him that I had to read it many times to even have a minor clue what was going on. A also played f2p games well over 2500 hours in the second half of last school year yet acing the test's with over 90 score which just gives idea how much time was spent on doing other things. Why did I bring A up? Because he's just so good reference point. You have one guy who does his best to grind and another one who does the minimal effort with maximal gain. Even if we were to pass the same test, I'd still have no chance of EVER gaining the level of thinking A has. Why? Well dear reader it's clear. He has far higher IQ than I do.

However, I had a revelation after studying the effects of mind altering drugs on the human consciousness. For example, I've had friends who did a lot of LSD and some of them describe seeing various monsters and leprechaun gods wandering around. Microwaves talking. Walls bubbling and changing colors.

Maybe that leprechaun god actually exists and is walking around me right now but I simply cannot feel or hear or see him because LSD is required to see him and my brain doesn't normally come into contact with LSD? Imagine if we had evolved in a primordial ooze that contained copious amounts of LSD. Imagine our species needed LSD to survive.

Russia is no fool, and I believe that they understood a Trump presidency would garner just the results that we see now a wildly unpopular president, at least with both the media and congress, and a much more divided nation. I don't think that anyone could disagree that half of the country that actually cares lost their minds when Trump won.

So long as the media continues to focus on scandals and allegations rather than policy and results, and the congress continues to devote resources to investigations rather than legislation, then Russia has succeeded undermining our electoral processes by disrupting the focus of both the american people and the congress by focusing attention away from policy. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

My argument is fairly simple Too often new mothers are given Formula to feed their babies, which is unjust. Formula isn't as good of nutrition, and should only be neccesary if there is a legitimate health concern where the mother and child can't feed. Over the course of millions of years, the Mammals have dominated our planet since the Cenozoic age. Our Name, mammal is a derivative of the word mammary , the Teat gland. We've existed for millions of years feeding off our mother's teats, yet only recently have adopted synthetic formula. Breastmilk s literally biologically built to nurture babies, and It's a fools errand to try and prove that Formula is a better, healthier substitute for breastmilk. By all means, show me data otherwise, i'm looking to give away a Delt Formula isn't as good for baby, and it causes undue financial distress, but unfortunately is easier for new mothers. Breastfeeding is hard work, especially for new mothers, so oftentimes In America, at least we abandon hope of breastfeeding and switch to formula within the first day. formula companies stock hospitals and line doctors' pockets in order to rope new, frustrated mothers into the formula easy train. I feel that this shouldn't be allowed, especially when formula is as expensive as it is. The world heath organization says that Children should be breastfed exclusively until 6 months, and should continue to breastfeed with solid food until 2 years. In America, roughly 4 5 of mothers ever try breastfeeding, and only 1 4 of mothers breastfeed until 6 months. PDF via CDC My solution is simple There is an international board that trains and certifies lactation consultants to inernational standards. they exist in America, but in appallingly small numbers. A session from an IBCLC International Board certified lactation consultant should be necessary before you are given a prescription for formula. In that session, the Consultant can educate you on why feeding is difficult, and reassure you that you CAN breastfeed. The modern American Model isn't focused enough on catering to the fears and needs of new mothers, and too often give them formula before mothers actually need it. Formula should be kept at a pharmacy, not at the hospital, and not in the grocery aisle. the only people who should need to give formula to their babies are in medical emergencies much like how we only prescribe pharmaceuticals to the ill. Breastfeeding rates need to come up, because as we breastfeed more, it will lessen financial strain for new families and raise the public health standards. I feel that the only way we can increase breastfeeding rates is to require a lactation consultant to diagnose you and your child as incapable of breastfeeding. Convince me there is any reason besides an immediate medical concern that a mother should be allowed to purchase baby formula. EDIT formatting. EDIT2 Ok, Jesus Christ, stop shouting at me. I'll have to change my view. Prescriptions aren't neccesary, because formula isn't addictive or harmful. Just because they are less healthy than boobs doesn't mean they should be regulated. My opinion on the International Standard still seems to stand, though. as of now we all seem to agree that breastmilk is better, so why shouldn't we do our best to ensure that all women are given the support and education needed to properly breastfeed? Breastfeeding is hard work, and unfortunately there are lots of problems that mothers don't know how to cope with. For instance if you'd like to breastfeed, but your supply lessens, giving your baby formula is the worst thing you can do for your supply. I feel that there should be a certified group of experts to see you when you have a child to help and inform you of things you may either be confused or scared about.

He made this comment after saying how intelligent and hard working a woman she is. There was a backlash from some feminists that was loud enough to make the president publicly apologize for his remarks. Yesterday, Buzzfeed posted an article discussing how some feminists are upset about the fact that men are allowed to sit how they like, and take up however much room they want, on public transportation. One commenter said she thought this was a valid criticism because it shows how it is inappropriate for women to act in certain manners, but society chooses to give men a pass. To me, these issues distract the broader public from the bigger ones that are being discussed today equality in the work place e.g. fair pay , contraception coverage in women's health insurance plans, and the widespread attacks on abortion in our country. Transitions in how we think about, talk about and view gender equality, just as it was with racial equality, unfortunately take time.

They don't have the same rights as humans, and there is no moral obligation to protect them, or to not hurt them. Of course, you might argue that there is, and that it is immoral to hurt them, and we would go nowhere. However, my main argument is this morality has a purpose. Something immoral isn't immoral just because, it is immoral and illegal for a reason. Murder is immoral because society could not function if humans frequently killed each others. When something is forbidden, it is because it would harm society. If you don't agree with that argument, I'll get back to it at the end of the post. There is no reason for harming animals to be immoral, because harming animals doesn't harm society. Animals aren't a part of society like humans are, and they don't need rights. Other humans have the same rights as I do because if I didn't consider them my equals, I would behave like a jerk, probably be dangerous, and I would be rejected from society. However, I don't interact with cows, therefore there is no point is giving them rights. Of course, this does not mean that animals can't be protected in some circumstances. Pets should be protected because they are part of families which care for them, and therefore their protection serves a purpose. Endangered species should of course be protected. There is no reason to protect animals in general. There are even many reasons not to. Humans currently eat meat, which would be a crime if animals had rights, but has many advantages and would be difficult to change. We also use a lot of animals to help us in many tasks horses, dogs , and it would be very difficult to do without them. Protecting animals would harm society. Also, a lot of wild animals suffer and die, because that is part of their lives. If ethics protected these animals, we would be morally obliged to help them, which would cost a lot of money and damage the ecosystem. The only way to morally protect animals is to be hypocritical and only do so when it is easy. Of course, a lot of people will disagree with my morality serves a purpose argument, and say that some things, like murder or harming animals, are fundamentally immoral, and that's it. However, this form of morality is subjective, and if you impose it upon others with animal protection laws, you are no better than religious extremists, or anyone else who forces others to follow their vision of the world."}, {"conclusion": "Opposing cultural appropriation runs contrary to the concept that anyone of any demographic should be free to engage in anything of any culture.", "id": 32249, "argument": "Opposing cultural appropriation is, ultimately, authoritarian.

This is a much clearer example of a Hatch violation. Comey did what he felt was right by informing voters.

In 2014, Cambridge University's not to be confused with Cambridge Analytica Russian American psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan put together an app that used Facebook's API to allow people logged in via Facebook to take a quiz. This quiz, when taken, allowed access to not only the user's information likes, favorite pages, username, gender, location, etc. , but also the user's friends' information. When Facebook found out in 2015 that Dr. Kogan violated their terms of service by selling user information to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook removed that feature called an edge from their API, which makes sense because it was abused in this instance. Now, developers making an app can only access a user's Facebook friends who have also downloaded and logged into said app. There's a taggable friends edge that can be accessed, but that only gives you the user's friends' names and default profile pictures. Long story short, I think that Facebook recognized a flaw in their platform and fixed it in 2015. The huge amount of blowback happening right now is primarily due to incorrectly calling what happened a 'breach,' and not recognizing that a loophole in the system was removed in 2015.

Proportion of x students with A's also not yet defined. If you are taking a college class, you are paying for it in some fashion. It is either costing you money or time almost always both . Your life is personally less beneficial, during that time frame, by the sheer virtue of being a student in this class. Suffice to say, this means you want to be there, and you want to learn the material enough to at least pass if not ace . The default claim is that classes are designed to teach a certain curriculum, and the students have to learn that basic information in a satisfactory fashion to receive credit for that class. My contention is if the class is extremely difficult, and very few students receive A's, then it is an issue of the Professor and not the students. If your class has 100 students, either be willing to give 10 students A's or if you do not feel like that number of students has earned that grade then the entire class should have the option to no credit the class with no penalty. We should assume most students strive for A's, and most students will work hard for those A's based on my aforementioned reasons. If you have a compelling reason to disagree, I'm interested in hearing it. We should also assume that the curriculum that has been created will sufficiently teach the material to students, at least to learn the material to a certain level to receive the grades we are discussing, ergo it has been proven that the same workload and same materials has been provided to other colleges or professors with students that have aced the class at the whatever rate. The point of this  is to pit the professor versus the student. Therefore, students should be graded along something similar to a perfect bell curve. A curve that is skewed to the left should only be acceptable if a certain number of A's have been assigned, given the class size. The reasoning for this is that it is obvious a certain percentage of the class is willing to get an A by any means necessary, and if the majority of these people are not getting A's then it is not their fault but the fault of the individual that is teaching the class. If that is the case, all students should have the option to strike the class from their record because the grade they received is tainted. The professor is shitty. Even the students that tried to learn everything failed. It is not fair to compare any student in that class' competency with students from classes with better professors. TL DR if you have 100 people in your class and everyone fails its not their fault. Its your fault, because you are a shitty professor. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Marijuana should be legalized for recreational purposes in the United States because of legalization\u2019s economic benefits, legalization\u2019s ability to prevent crime and death, as well as provide education, and because marijuana provides unique health benefits and offers medicinal value. Legalization has been a hot button topic for many years in the United States, particularly because opponents of legalization claim that marijuana is detrimental to human health. However, this could not be further from the truth According to a study published in American Scientist that focuses on the toxicity of recreational drugs and comparing them to alcohol, alcohol is at least 100 times more toxic than marijuana The Toxicity of\u2026 . This proves that substances that are currently legal are far more unhealthy than marijuana, and therefore marijuana should have no reason not to be legalized. Furthermore, the CDC records over 37,000 annual deaths solely from alcohol use. Conversely, there has not even been one documented case of death due to marijuana use, and if such a dangerous substance is legalized in the status quo, there is once again absolutely no reason for marijuana not to be legalized Alcohol and Public\u2026 . All in all, if alcohol is to be legal in the status quo, arguing that marijuana is unhealthy for consumption is simply factually incorrect. In fact, the opposite is true, because marijuana has a multitude of health benefits. One aspect not often considered when weighing advantages and disadvantages of marijuana legalization is the economic aspect. Legalizing marijuana will undoubtedly create an industry behind it that will allow the trade of the substance, and this industry, as well as the halting of criminalization of marijuana, will greatly contribute to the economy. For example, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, the United States currently spends over 51 billion annually to fight marijuana Drug War Statistics . These are taxpayer dollars being completely wasted, because there is an opportunity cost to spending money on fighting drugs. Tax dollars can contribute to public services such as education, roads, and public safety, but instead the government throws away hard earned money without achieving much success. Furthermore, legalization in one state California would generate over 1.4 billion in revenue, contributing to the economy and upping the GDP, at the same time as generating new jobs for the agricultural and sales backend Drug War Statistics . It is also estimated that if marijuana was taxed at the same rate as alcohol and tobacco after it was legalized and implemented, there would be over 46.7 billion in tax revenue Drug War Statistics . In the status quo, the United States is currently throwing money at an \u201cissue\u201d that does not even need to exist. In the status quo, the US is foregoing fantastic economic growth opportunities. Legalizing marijuana will allow for the alleviation of the economic harm, and at the same time capitalize on gargantuan economically beneficial situations. Because marijuana possession or trade is currently illegal, it comes as no surprise that many people currently suffer in prison or lose out on much needed education for breaking these laws. In Mexico, the source for much of the marijuana trafficking into the United States, over 6,290 murders were attributed directly to illicit drug trade in the year 2008 alone. DEA Mexican Drug Violence . Since 2006, over 100,000 deaths have occurred in the Mexican Drug War, both on Mexican soil and US soil Drug War Statistics . This senseless killing needs to be put to a stop, and it isn\u2019t just gangs at fault, it is also law enforcement. If marijuana is legalized, this tremendous amount of drug warfare will be greatly diminished, if not stopped altogether. Gangs that traffic drugs will no longer be able to distribute the most popular drug, and the violence that once occurred from gangs will cease. Law enforcement will also no longer have to kill and incarcerate those who possess marijuana. As of the year 2013, over 609 thousand people were incarcerated solely for marijuana possession. Many people like to point the finger at those who break the law, but when over 1 3 of the prison population exists solely for the violation of a single law, there is a clear issue Drug War Statistics . Legalizing marijuana will take over 609 thousand people out of prison, solving the overpopulation issue and adding back into society those who had their lives stolen because of unjust laws. Finally, over 200,000 students have lost financial aid eligibility due to violation of a marijuana law Drug War Statistics . This is an obscene and grotesque violation of a right to education. Because of a petty violation that should not even be considered a crime, students are losing the ability to attain higher education funding. All in all, in the status quo, thousands are losing their lives. These human lives have family, friends, and did not deserve to die. In the status quo, hundreds of thousands are imprisoned for what should not be considered a crime. They are kept from their family and friends and have their futures tainted with their incarceration. In the status quo, hundreds of thousands of students will not receive an education because the government is focused more on fighting a useless fight than on educating the future. Already proven is the fact that marijuana is not highly detrimental to health. In reality, marijuana has huge health benefits, aside from the classic \u201chigh\u201d that is attained through its consumption. According to a study performed by the National Eye Institute marijuana can be used to treat glaucoma by lowering high pressures in the eye. Welsh Another study in the Journal of the American Medical Association corroborates evidence that marijuana can actually improve lung capacity and reverse negative effects of tobacco smoking, also linking back to prove that marijuana does not harm health. This study was sampled with over five thousand participants over 20 years. DeLorenzo of Virginia Commonwealth University published findings that show that marijuana reduces the frequency and severity of epileptic seizures. California Pacific Medical Center also reported that marijuana had the ability to inhibit the spread of cancer, by suppressing a gene that duplicates quickly in cancer cells. Harvard Medical School researchers have even suggested that marijuana has curative abilities for those who suffer from severe anxiety. Janda of the Scripps Research Institute claims that marijuana can inhibit enzymes that kill brain cells, therefore stopping Alzheimer\u2019s root cause. The Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests that marijuana could potentially reduce the extreme pain felt by sufferers of multiple sclerosis. Marijuana presents itself as a solution to PTSD as well, as the Department of Health and Human Services states Welsh . Marijuana has far too many benefits to be kept illegal. It presents itself as treatment for multiple chronic illnesses, both physical and mental. It is wrong to make such fantastic treatment unavailable to those who truly need it, especially as there are no health downsides to marijuana. In the status quo, those who could benefit greatly from marijuana treatment are denied the very care they need, the same care that could potentially save a human life, or put an end to depression. In summary, it has been clearly shown that opponents of legalization are stuck under a false pretense of unhealthiness, especially because not only does marijuana have few, if any negative qualities, it has marvelous medical and therapeutic abilities. Moreover, it has also been shown that the legalization of marijuana consumption would incur tremendous economic benefits for each state and the country as a whole, while putting an end to the wasteful spending on the drug war. Finally, it has been shown that marijuana possesses fantastic abilities to assist those with certain medical conditions and improve their quality of life. Marijuana needs to be legalized in the United States because it will generate an exorbitant amount of money while cutting down on wasteful spending, because it will lead to fewer innocent lives being ended or held in a prison as well as increase the amount of educated populous the United States has, and because marijuana, once available, will help many people that suffer from many different ailments to recover and feel less pain, less sick, and less unhealthy. To let this issue pass by is to be ignorant of the facts and ignorant of the magnitude of the impact on the status quo. Marijuana legalization, what seems like a relatively small decision, will impact the world in a big way, and only for the better."}, {"conclusion": "Trump has not been in office long enough to credibly claim significant positive impact from his leadership.", "id": 119747, "argument": "It is too early to determine whether or not these changes will stick.

And I love a great conspiracy theory as much as the next guy but this whole Bundy Ranch thing is getting convoluted. Basically, from what I've gathered, this guys' family has had this ranch for generations and used the land adjacent to their ranch which they do not own as grazing ground for their cattle. That was all fine until public property laws started popping up. The state started making his family pay grazing fees for their cattle grazing on land they didn't technically own. They were ok with this. It was controlled by the local government at that time. Then came about the federal establishment, Bureau of Land Management. Now how they were given justification, if at all, over this public property that Bundy's cattle graze on I have no idea. But apparently it wasn't an issue at first because Bundy had started making his annual grazing fees to them without issue. Then apparently around 20 years ago he had an issue with BLM that I'm unclear on other than he said they were managing him out of business and decided to stop paying grazing fees. He says he's made attempts to pay the state of Nevada the grazing fees but they refuse to take it, which makes sense if it's a federally controlled thing now. So for ~20 years they let him continue to use land that wasn't his without paying his grazing fees. So now I know about the endangered tortoise ploy as well as the Chinese energy company solar panel field conspiracy and Sen. Reid and his son's involvement. There may be some ulterior motive, I'm not saying there isn't, involved in this land deal for the solar panels but there have been at least one report that the projected area for the solar panel field doesn't even come into either the Bundy Ranch nor the contested land this whole dispute is about And the tortoise thing? Could be explained as an easy albeit unethical way of getting federal involvement into this issue faster.

I wish to argue that a part of my consciousness is not made of matter or other particles or energy and therefore cannot be a part of a simulated universe. If you disagree with the simulation hypothesis you can still follow through with the argument, but your conclusions may differ. Let's imagine you, the reader going about your day. Unbeknownst to you, a clone of you is made. Atom for atom, particle for particle, no matter how an outside observer would examine you and the clone, they wouldn't be able to find a difference between you and the clone, except for your different positions in space. Would your experience of life change if you were not aware of the clone being created? Why would it? You'd just go about your business. Now with that established, image that you were asleep and the clone was created right next to you creepy, I know , just as you were waking up. You'd open your eyes and experience life through your body and your senses, not the ones of the clone and vice versa. Why is that? Why do you wake up inside your body, and not the clone's? You are physically identical yet a difference exists. No matter how identical the two bodies are, you will always wake up in your's and not the clone's. Let's make an analogy, where your body is a theater and your senses are the movie playing. No matter how similar a theater we build next to it, you'd still be watching the movie in the first one. You, the viewer, are always viewing one movie, even if the exact same movie is played in the cinema next to you. The viewer is not a consciousness. It is only a property \u2013 a one dimensional factor \u2013 that makes you experience life through your body, and not someone else's. The viewer cannot be physical because then we could build it into the theater, into the clone, and you could start experiencing life through your clones eyes. You can know for a fact that you have a viewer, but, whether everyone else has one cannot be proven. All other humans and conscious beings could just be philosophical zombies, empty theaters with a movie playing and no one watching. A simulation of all particles in the universe couldn't simulate your viewer even if it could simulate other viewers, which is complicated, as the concept of a viewer starts to break down as soon as it isn't your viewer that you already are. Viewers cannot be observed and therefore difficult to imagine in others. . When stating that the viewer is non physical, I am using the word physical in the broadest sense. If you were to suggest that the viewer could be moved to another body, could be created, or destroyed, you'd just be moving the problem up a level to why are you this viewer and not that viewer, leading to viewer viewers and so on.

I'm a guy in his 30s whos lucky enough to date his crush. But I feel that I'm not worthy of her and she can do far better than me. Here's why Let's say that my gf makes some requests like Can you please join me for XYZ party? I could do with some company there and I would love to have you with me. It's an ordinary request. Most other people can fulfill it. I can't because of the shame that will come up when I start interacting with other people and she gets to know how I interact with other people. I'm quite awkward in social groups and get nervous from time to time. Also, I'm horrible at initiating topics but if someone else initiates then I can catch those social clues and carry the conversation forward. I can however speak normally in 1 1 conversations. Conclusion A bf who can't speak to her colleagues properly, who's socially awkward is an embarrassment reflected on her. A bf is worthless it if he cannot bring up grown up topics with other people, and if he's lacking in social tact. Even as a man it makes one worthless if you cannot bring up grown up topics even though you are in your 30s. Have a grown up conversation with my gf while hanging outside with her somewhere I can make conversations with her normally and crack jokes. But I suddenly get quiet and ashamed of myself because of the kind of conversations I make. Guys in their 30s talk about businesses, corporates, news, politics, complex country strategies, country laws, company laws you see? Big things Grown up topics. And I talk about so ordinary things feelings, dreams, past events, random opinions that aren't thought out. It's so shameful. I feel that a bf is worthless if he cannot talk about grown up topics. We can conclude that the bf is lacking in social skills which makes him worthless. She can bring up important issues very assertively. But I just can't. When she brings it up then we discuss it and it gets resolved. But I just can't bring it up. I have not even identified it as an issue that needs to be discussed. But she can do that. This is a very basic social skill and I'm lacking in this. This means that I'm a useless person. What kind of a man can't bring up things that are hurting him in conversation? It just stays embedded inside me. And what kind of a person gets so much of hurt accumulated so quickly. I'm drawing a lot of conclusions about my worth in many situations.

Usually, the bad knees thing just forced me to put my feet under their seat and lock them straight anyway but even still, their reclining kills any personal space I have to read, use my laptop, whatever. Also, I usually travel with kids. I do everything I can to control them and make my neighbors comfortable. In fact, I've only ever been glared at once with my kids and that was when one of them was an infant like less than a month old and we flew to asia. She cried for about 10 minutes once and I got a few glares that was it. Anyway. So now, to protect my space I always put my hands on the seatback of the person in front of me when they are about to recline. Always. I'm sorry, but I just don't leave that choice. Their reclining is extremely uncomfortable for me and I don't feel that I should have to spend 1,500 on an airline ticket to have no personal bubble for 14 hours. Not happening.

As far as I know In the US you can buy a weapon at every corner without having much more than an ID card. So here is my thesis I think that it is not neccessary to carry a weapon for self defense or even have one at your home. The odds that you are threated by a weapon are very low. Fewer weapons means fewer weapons you could get threated by. Fewer weapons means fewer accidents with weapons. I would be glad if you could change my view. P.S. Sorry for the bad english. It is sometimes hard express what I have in my mind in the English language. Edit Formatting, lesser gt fewer Update Thanks for all the kind discussions. I now have to leave and will check back tomorrow. I had not thought that this would be possible but my view has at least changed a bit. I now understand that it is far more dangerous to live in a US city tehn it is in a German city. Defense seems to be the top reason for buying a gun. Update 2 A colleague of mine reminded me that it is legal in some playes in the US to by machineguns and so on.

I see the media as portraying this as a terrorist attack, and many people Such as Trump and his supporters railing on Obama and other Democrats for not calling this Islamic Terrorism. But let me flip the discussion and argue the fact that the terrorism argument is just now being made is disingenuous and fueled by racism. Now, shortly after the Pulse shooting, there was another shooting that didn't get as much media attention, at least in the U.S. A Radical Nationalist in Britain assassinated a major official because of her anti Brexit views. This is textbook terrorism, using violence and fear to push an agenda. Yet there's a stark different in googling Brexit terrorist and Orlando terrorist , as in nothing about the assassination comes up on the first yet there is all kinds of info on the latter. Nobody wants to acknowledge this white man as a terrorist. But if we look at the major mass shootings in the U.S in the past few years, we find that almost every single one in recent history was done by a white gunman with no ties to Islam or any terror cells. Where do we draw the line between disturbed mental patient and terrorist ? If we need to acknowledge the fact it was towards homosexuals who are a persecuted group in Islam, and therefore view it as a hate crime justified through the lens of a backwards dogma, then that would make the Charleston shooter a year or two back a terrorist by the same principle. Next argument I anticipate is the fact he pledged allegiance to ISIS after his massacre. This is true, but he had no previous ties to any major terror organization before this, and did it as a way to suppress his own homosexual desires and win favor with any terror cell he could, as he pledged himself to several rival cells. Its clear from testimonies from his family and former loved ones that he was very mentally disturbed from the beginning. Now, I'm not trying to say he isn't a terrorist, because he absolutely is one. But so is the person who killed that M.P in Britian. And so is the kid who shot up a black church in Charleston. I'm only pointing all of this out because people seem to forget that the vast majority of these sort of shootings are done by white Christians with no ties to any organized terror cell.  that this shooting constitutes the usage of the word terrorism more than the previous ones did."}, {"conclusion": "A democratic nation should not be wholly inclusive/tolerant, in terms of who they allow to immigrate in, unless they want to risk their culture and way of life.", "id": 70500, "argument": "When this topic first came up to me, I was of the opinion that for a democratic nation to exclude certain groups of people from immigrating into their country for fear of said groups changing the demographics and culture, was inherently wrong. I wasn't able to articulate why I felt that way, but it just seemed undemocratic. But then after discussing the issue with a friend, it was brought to my attention that not only do immigrants not have a right to immigrate to whatever democratic nation is in question but that it's justifiable to turn them away if it could lead to a shift in the majority popuation culture which would undermine or diminish the current culture. gt For example, if country X started allowing mass immigration of people who subscribed to religion Y, the people in country X would then have legislation or representatives in their government who would be forced to pander to those of religion Y despite the fact that the citizens of X do not subscribe to Y. Y may even clash with the beliefs and values of the citizens of X. I would like someone to change my view because I still feel deep down this is the wrong way to look at the situation. Filtering immigrants for the sake of maintaining a ratio of one group to another in order to maintain a cultural majority in a democracy seems wrong. But I haven't thought of a decent counterargument yet. tl dr Maintaining cultural ratios through selective immigration policies within a democratic country for the sake of maintaining the nation's culure in general isn't wrong.

If morality is a total measure of happiness and suffering over time with happiness counting positively and suffering counting negatively , then if we cut short the life of someone who was only going to lower the overall balance with his misery, don't we raise the total? It seems so. But this same logic would tell us to euthanize anyone whose lifetime suffering was bound to outweigh his lifetime happiness, and that's\u2026 certainly counterintuitive. And at any rate, even if the overall happiness suffering balance is improved, this still plainly fails euthanasia's professed purpose, which is to relieve the suffering of the person whose life is ended.

Adjust for inflation 1982 2015 , that's 13,378. Today, Notre Dame cost of attendance is 64,775. So why is college almost five times as expensive as it was then? I think one serious reason college is so expensive, especially high price schools like Loyola Marymount University my school is because kids these days are too spoiled. I think on some level I'm a spoiled brat. I lived with my parents until I was almost 25 largely because I refused to live without a dishwasher. When I was looking for a college, I was looking for a good school, a nice campus and good student life, and mainly a great location. I was so tired of living in Detroit I wanted to either be in NYC, LA Chicago or some other major city. Quality of education and cost of tuition were barely even considerations. Today, kids look for the following things in a college Location Quality of gym facilities Quality of study abroad Beauty of campus Dining options And my school Loyola Marymount is the worst offender, yes they have a full service on campus restaurant that serves steak. They are always building some multimillion dollar construction project. For the past 10 years, there has been a construction crane on campus. If it's not new dorms, it's a new library, now its a new science center. Kids are paying all this money to live in a construction zone. College have to build nice campuses with million dollar recreation centers because that's what kids look for in a university these days. Another major reason is a circular problem federal government makes policies that make waaay too many student loans available. So colleges have no incentive whatsoever to reduce tuition costs colleges know there are plenty of kids out there with good cosigners and hence unlimited access to student loans. So why bother reducing tuition. Colleges raise tuition 5 every year. When college tuition goes up, federal government responds by increasing loan availability to make it more affordable. But when colleges see more loans available, they make it more expensive just because they can. Again, kids are too privileged in the sense that they have credit worthy cosigners for loans. Kids did not have these resources in the 70s and 80s and that's. If any college charged 64,000 year in the 80s, they'd have empty classrooms and would close."}, {"conclusion": "France and Britain should be willing to give up their seats for the European Union.", "id": 112310, "argument": "The most practical way to reform the United Nations is for France and Britain to give way to a European Union seat.

Personally I think that sex is much more than just intercourse, it's more emotional, spiritual, the bond shared by two people. Married, couples, even friends with benefits show that it's not just intercourse and it's all great and dandy. However events such as one night stands, craigslist hookups and etc with just picking up a random person without knowing anything about them and exploiting the situation is just nothing more than acting like pigs fucking randomly in their own mess. By the next day nothing is accomplished except for a temporary satisfaction and if anything your time is wasted since this feeling will go away.

The lights, music for the most part, actually some of my favorite artists are techno trance and so forth in clubs and other establishments are nothing more than ways to exploit naive, peacock esque youths for the aura and chance of mindless sex.

Second, for the it's my body approach sure, that's great however if you want to have sex why not have a friend with benefit at least? At least that way the sex can be more than just intercourse. Third, I'm not a virgin or anything. I've ironically had much sexual experience, especially with friends with benefits. I've even a one night stand however almost immediately I felt guilty about it and the sexual release went away almost immediately.

Nevertheless, it is still the statistically superior option since I assume that a God would tend to prefer believers to agnostics and atheists. I genuinely feel like the only real objection I have to believing is the difficulty of some of the teachings.

I will not be voting. There is a reason for this let me explain. I have no idea what perspective you might have on this, dear reader, but I have thought about it enough to take an official stance. As such, my decision is be colored by a few premises. They are as follow. One. My opinion is not important. Many people vote with the intention to make a difference, to make their voice heard. Well I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but the presidential race is not a democracy. The votes are little more than suggestions to the representatives who were elected by hand picked puppets of a political party voting in a meta election with a convoluted system that most people don\u2019t even understand, and even if it was a direct choice of the people, one vote is nothing. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. Even if only half the population voted, I would still only have 1 159,000,000th of a choice on anything. If every vote was a 1 ounce feather on a scale that decides the election, my feather would have to tip the scales as they balance five 30 thousand TON cruise ships in order to make a difference. No, every vote certainly does not count. Not everyone is going to vote like me, And, the opportunity to shout your punitive thoughts into the black void of a ballot box like the tiny insignificant speck of statistical nothingness you are is not even worth the effort of walking down the block to do it 2 I also have moral reasons for not voting beleive it or not. Think about all the people in the country. All 318 million of them. Consider that half of them are below average intelligence. The voters are morons. I am a moron. We can\u2019t know what to think. The political environment is simply too complex to comprehend without extensive research, critical thinking, considering of ideologies, truth seeking, and good ol\u2019 stubborn cynicism and distrust. Those who vote in a certain way because they believed an advertisement, or were convinced during a debate, or grew up in an echo chamber of homogeneous opinions are not voting any more responsibly than someone who picks a candidate because they like their face. It takes work to decide with an informed and well reasoned voice, who to vote for work that most people aren\u2019t going to do. Work that I\u2019m not going to do. At the very least it would require giving up my time every day to watch the news, and my sanity just can't take that. 3 To even stay informed and watch the news is to expose yourself to the most toxic bubbling stew of hatred and fear mankind has ever developed. It is the direct assault on the mental fortitude of man as he attempts to beat back the tide of regurgitated hysteria with his pitiable faculties of logic. And it never stops. More than that it sustains itself. It becomes habit forming, you develop rigidly factional tunnel vision aimed only at the proliferation of your faith and the destruction of your enemies. For it\u2019s desires are your desires. Andi it desires you to keep watching. Keep tuning in, keep on clicking because a click is all you will ever be worth to it. It is the bane of all that reason and fair judgement have accomplished in this world, and I refuse to trudge through the raging ocean of vomit to find the nugget of truth needed to make an informed choice. And even if I did trudge through. What would I do with what I learned? my knowledge only weighs as much as a feather after all. EDIT 1 I've goten many replies allong the lines of the presidential elections may be decided but the local elections can come down to a hair's margin. Even in a local election with only a few thousand voters, a hair's margin is still going to be far more than 1 vote. EDIT 2 The more convincing argument against what I've said is that a vote should be viewed as more of a symbolic gesture that says I do or do not support our representatives, and a protest vote will still influence political decisions. I'll ignore the weight of a vote for a moment to say You're probably right. EDIT 3 Thank you for all the interesting responses and arguments. I'm considering going down to the polls now, not quite convinced that it will make a difference, but simply so I can honestly say fuck this candidate or policy in particular. I voted against it so it isn't my fault even by virtue of association. I still think that It's irresponsible of me to do it without knowing who I'm voting for, but what the hell, why not?

Certain brain areas related to personal identity go into overdrive, treating opposing evidence like an existential threat", "id": 7240, "argument": "The Gender Wage gap is a topic of contention in the US many conservatives denounce the gap as a myth, while liberals tend to speak out against the gap, placing blame primarily on workplace discrimination, especially by the men making hiring decisions for these companies. The wage gap, as defined by this piece, is \u201cthe average difference between male and female earnings, expressed as a percentage of male earnings\u201d. I\u2019ll focus on just the pay gap in the United States, but it\u2019s worth noting in every country on earth, men on average earn more The wage gap in the US is currently close to 78 , meaning for every dollar that the average man made in 2014, the average woman made 78 cents. This leads to women being more likely to live below the poverty line in the US compared to men If you are an egalitarian, or if you have a sense of justice, and forget everything else about this issue whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative this should trouble you. A person should not be more likely to live in poverty just because she was born a woman. So when a fact this upsetting comes to you, there are two very human responses. Denial Anger In my experience, conservatives seem to deny the problem while liberals tend to become angry about it. Anger, in my opinion, actually does some good. Angry people spread awareness, hold rallies, write blog posts, etc. However, anger can also be damaging to the movement. Angry people exaggerate, and might attack or alienate would be allies. This next part is where a liberal reader might get upset. The wage gap where the 78 statistic comes from is an average. Angry, exaggerating liberal groups often say \u201cWomen get 78 cents on the dollar for equal work\u201d, but the fact this, this number was not calculated by controlling for \u201cequal work\u201d. Instead male engineers and CEOs were compared with equal weight to female social workers and maids. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, when you do attempt to control for \u201cequal work\u201d the pay gap shrinks to closer to 5 This still does not compare based completely \u201cequal work\u201d though, only on age, education, experience, marital status, number of children, race, and religion and the study concludes that more of the gap could still be explained by missing variables. The denial crowd will insist the number might go down even further if you also compared the stress and danger levels of the job, the commute time, overtime hours, and ability willingness to negotiate for higher salary. This is all very comforting for the denial crowd. For them, this means we don\u2019t live in such an evil, sexist society after all it\u2019s just that women make different choices than men, study different topics, and prefer a less salary focused work life balance. However, in addition to being comforted, the denial crowd also gets a little bit angry hearing all this Why are the liberals still yelling? Why are they lying claiming that the 78 statistic controlled for everything? I thought this was solved, guys, why am I a misogynist for recognizing that stat is being taken out of context it\u2019s just an AVERAGE \u2026And this next part should make the conservative reader feel a bit less at ease But the fact is, the vast majority of academics believe that workplace bias and sexism do play at least some role causing the gender pay gap. In the words of John Oliver, \u201cIf someone takes a dump on my desk, the size of the dump is not the issue. I\u2019m not going to say \u2018well, how big of a dump is it?\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s almost like you didn\u2019t take on my desk at all \u201d\u201d. But the most troubling thing that conservatives should be aware of, is that even if sexism played 0 role in directly causing the gender pay gap, the bigger issue is the role that sexism plays INDIRECTLY to create the gender pay gap. So lets say the gap really is only caused by women making different choices Why do they make different choices? Boys are taught from a very young age that they should make loads of money and become an engineer or a CEO. Women are taught to look pretty and become a mother. It\u2019s in our movies, our TV even our actual lives, where fathers tend to be the primary breadwinners of the family while mothers cook dinner and change diapers. All of these subtle pressures and more contribute the the 78 gap. It\u2019s very possible that there have been a handful of female Einsteins over time, that, if given the opportunity, could have invented a cure for cancer, a solution to the world\u2019s energy crisis. But she didn\u2019t, because she was raised believing that science was for boys. So the whole world is missing out. Sexism is deeply ingrained in today\u2019s culture in America and it\u2019s almost impossible to step away from it. And it\u2019s not just men guilty of it, it\u2019s women too. A study was done where professors were given identical resumes the only difference was the name at the top was changed between \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cJennifer\u201d. Both male and female professors offered on average 4000 more for the male candidate. In the case of this study, it is reasonable to assume that the employers were not intentionally giving John more money because he was male. What I believe happened is the professors tried their best to honestly assess what each candidate was worth, without ever consciously acknowledging that gender played a role in their calculation. But it happened anyway because the sexism is so deeply rooted in all of us, that we don\u2019t always realize when it\u2019s affecting our decision making. This silent, entrenched sexism is the scariest of all, and it will take a huge cultural shift in order to fix it. Takeaway for conservatives We all know it would be nice if there was no pay gap, or if we could explain away the gap as somehow \u201cfair\u201d. But the truth is, even if no individual actors are behaving in an evil or misogynistic fashion, the gap itself is reflective of something very negative about our society. It\u2019s best to acknowledge that, and try to understand why liberals are angry rather than denying that they should be. Takeaway for liberals Sure, there are some goons at the top of the financial totem pole pulling some fucked up Mad Men bullshit on their female employees they should be arrested. But by making it sound like this is the norm at your average company is going to turn off a lot of skeptics. Stick to the facts, don\u2019t exaggerate, and you\u2019ll find that you have a lot more allies than enemies. Exaggerations are easier to deny than facts, and if you want the denial crowd to come around, you can\u2019t give them easy targets of deniable rhetoric the main one being that these studies, especially the 78 one, are comparing apples to apples ."}, {"conclusion": "Research suggests that cultural diversity in the workplace leads to more conflict.", "id": 40030, "argument": "Fiske 1998 and Hunter 2009 show that the primary dimensions of diversity - such as race, age and gender - can lead to discrimination, stereotyping and prejudices if there is little to no experience in working as a group. p. 107"}, {"conclusion": "If God is real, then we should file a class action lawsuit against it.", "id": 122304, "argument": "There exists a plethora of legal claims that could be filed against god for adjudication."}, {"conclusion": "The tensions between full freedom and citizens' responsibilities are characteristics of a healthy democracy.

Misappropriation to take something dishonestly for your own use. My views In modern times, the word Queer was exclusively used to defame effeminate men up until the reclamation movement. I personally have never heard of any woman being labelled with the word \u201cqueer\u201d as a slur. I believe the majority of those uniting under the \u201creclaimed\u201d queer umbrella are individuals that are part of the Queer Theory movement, an offshoot of third wave feminism. A larger percentage of women identify as feminists than men. It is my view that within the LGBT community, more women are identifying as \u201cqueer\u201d than men are. The use of the word \u2018queer\u2019 by women is a form of misappropriation. The word was never used as a slur against women and for women to unite under the banner of something that is still considered by many men and women as a slur is taking the word dishonestly for their own use. Extreme example To me, the use of \u201cqueer\u201d by women would be equivalent to individuals of an Asian background \u201creclaiming\u201d and uniting under the term \u201cnigger\u201d. Queer is much less offensive than this particular example \u2013 but I believe this is an adequate comparison. That slur was never levied against those individuals and it is misappropriation for those who the term was never used against to reclaim the word. Secondary example for those who disagree with the above example Many view the word dyke as being reclaimed. Would it be appropriate for me, as a gay man, to refer to myself as a dyke? How is this different from the pejorative queer being appropriated by non men? My view is that the reclamation of the word \u201cqueer\u201d by women is a form of misappropriation \u2013 and should not be supported. Ways to challenge my view Demonstrate that \u201cqueer\u201d women were once called queer en masse as a pejorative. Demonstrate that the majority of individuals uniting under the queer umbrella are men. Demonstrate that it is not misappropriation for individuals to reclaim a word that was never levied against them as a slur."}, {"conclusion": "People who are pro-choice but don't condone late-term abortions are not logically consistent.", "id": 41135, "argument": "I'll keep this short and sweet. Personally, I am pro choice but also a proponent of late term abortions. People are initially shocked by this but when they hear me out they kind of understand, and I even convert some of them. Abortion cutoffs are typically around the point of viability. So let's say a woman wants an abortion at 20 weeks. Here are some facts about that baby It's not self aware, so it wouldn't be sad to die No one knows it personally has interacted with it It doesn't know anyone personally either It has no memories Thus, nothing is being lost here. This is why I'm pro choice in the first place, because it benefits the mother and the economy at no cost. However, all of these are also applicable to late term abortions. In other words, the point of viability is irrelevant because you can't show me anything more that is being lost when a late term baby dies than when a fetus dies. I would go so far as to say that if a baby were instantly killed right as it came out of the womb naturally, there would honestly be no loss.

I also realize we can get into trouble with interpretations of rigged. So what do I mean? I mean that the DNC did not pursue actions to favor specifically Hillary over specifically Bernie to any degree that affected the outcome of the primary. What I don't mean. The DNC did not have rules in place that benefit an establishment candidate over another. You can not feel that actions and rules of the DNC were stupid. My issue with the idea that the election is rigged is that this paints a picture of the DNC working specifically to promote one candidate over the other. In reality, the rules were known beforehand and Bernie and his supporters dropped the ball on following them. For example, many people complain about the deadline to register as a Democrat. While the complaints that it is unreasonable can certainly be valid, the rules weren't suddenly changed to hurt Sanders, which is the picture painted when it is called rigged. For that matter, closed versus open primaries. While there are valid arguments that primaries should be open or semi open, you can not deny that there are good arguments for leaving a primary closed in order to let people who have declared themselves Democrats to vote on which Democrat they want, and especially to not let Republicans have a say. I actually stand on the side of semi closed primaries as best, but I think it is silly to call it rigged. Voter supression. The primaries are run by the states and the places with the most voter supression are states run by Republicans. Anyone who was angry at the DNC about long lines in a place like Arizona outs themselves as having no clue what they are talking about. Hillary won nearly 3.8 million more votes than Sanders did, with a total count of 27.8 million so over 10 of the total. More importantly, she cemented the bulk of her lead on Super Tuesday, when her lead became so great that every primary from that point on Sanders had to win what, 60 of the vote at least just to stay even , and every primary he didn't win by that much he needed to win future ones even more decisively. Can you honestly tell me that the DNC rigged it so that Bernie lost by these amounts? A few more notes on arguments I have heard so far that don't I press me. Emails pertaining to discussions by DNC members that show bias, such as the question about Sanders' religious beliefs. I think we run into a painfully obvious problem here that he wasn't asked about it. You can certainly argue that the DNC members showing any bias even in private was unprofessional, but people having discussion in private emails does not equate to rigging. I have also seen people bringing up the DNC acting as though Hillary had already won in May except she basically had. Frankly the race was over after Super Tuesday without a miracle, and by May that miracle was clearly not coming. At this point if the DNC wanted the best chance at winning the General, they should have pushed far harder than they did to get rid of Bernie. Of course that would have played even more into the image of rigging, and so they let him continue to attack the DNC itself, and let his supporters have a platform to make accusations of rigging. So, what would it take to change my mind? Frankly evidence that early on the DNC took concrete steps that can be shown to have actually happened to push Hillary over Bernie. Frankly anything done after Super Tuesday would have to be momumental.

That one focused too much on the movie as a whole I want to focus on Killmonger's character development. So a few issues I had with Killmonger's development and plotline Klaue. I do not understand why Killmonger needed to be with Klaue. He worked with Klaue, stole an object, the object was sold and then taken by the government, and then he busted Klaue out of jail. Then he killed Klaue and took his body to Wakanda as an offering. The question is why? How? How could he have known that Black Panther spared Klaue's life during the car chase scene after the casino? He never met T'Challa before and doesn't know his character. He also didn't know W'Kabi. He had absolutely no possible idea that Klaue's death would have had such a polarizing effect on the Wakandan society. He killed Klaue as an offering to get into the country. So, why did he wait? Why did he work with Klaue at all? He didn't need money, weapons, or directions. He knew where Wakanda was. And honestly, he didn't even need Klaue to get into Wakanda. The tattoo and ring were enough to get an audience with the king. Killmonger's motivation for being king. I know he saw oppression and wanted to use Vibranium weapons to help overthrow the oppressors. But we don't see his motivation in depth. We know where it came from. As a society, we see that today. But Killmonger dedicated his entire life, killed hundreds of people, became one of the most proficient human fighters in the world, all for this very purpose. I just feel like that in order to have that extreme level of motivation, he would have needed a more deeply personal connection to everything. I know that his father held the same views, and probably passed those views down to him. But it was just too brief and too short. I would have liked to see Killmonger experience some of this oppression himself. Or even just talk about it. Talk about a personal experience, maybe when he was on tour during his special forces days, where he saw oppression happening and wished he could help. It didn't feel personal enough to harbor a lifelong vendetta against an entire nation. W'Kabi's response to Klaue's escape. This is a bit on a tangent, but I think it's necessary because it's a vital plot point for the next point. W'Kabi got angry and disappointed at T'Challa for failing, to the point where he was willing to destroy all Wakandan traditions and kill his childhood friend. He waited 20 years for Klaue to get caught. T'Chakka never even tried to go after Klaue. T'Challa tried, and could've killed Klaue, but didn't for the sake of W'Kabi and also to avoid a publicity issue . He TRIED. He failed once. W'Kabi will have to wait a few more weeks or months before getting his revenge. But the guy waited 20 years. He's willing to throw everything away over a single failure? That brings me to the next Killmonger issue. He violently destroys Wakanda's culture and religion, and yet everyone still follows him. The airship pilots are so quick to act on delivering weapons to the rest of the world. W'Kabi's tribe follows his ideals despite the fact that they're all Wakandans too. It just feels like such a massive lack of loyalty. I really want to  here because I feel that Killmonger is such a great character.

But once it can be proved it was a break in, you should not face criminal charges. nbsp Basically, the life of a stranger that broke into your house is worth a LOT less than the safety of you and your family. You don't know their intentions, therefore you should assume the worst and make sure they can't do anything instead of figuring out the very hard way what their intentions are. Calling the police should also not be what you do. In the 5 15 minutes it takes for the police to come, there is a very small chance the criminal will sit down with you for tea and wait. They may leave, they may kill you instead. Therefore you should take you your family's protection into your own hands."}, {"conclusion": "Those \"You can do anything/Your limit is only in your mind\" quotes are mostly unhelpful!", "id": 118563, "argument": "Of course, every quote and analogy breaks at some point, and I know that those quotes should not be taken absolutely literal.

Secondly, govermment spending to reduce unequality is most effective to reduce violent criminality. Death penalty is thus, not a priority or goal, it's the final solution after nothing has worked out. I don't support it for emotional or moral reasons such as ''justice'', my reasoning is purely logical and utilitarist I don't live in America, I live in Brazil. A notorious criminal for one of the most brutal murder rape cases on our country's entire history I'm not gonna describe what he did, some people might get triggered known as ''Champinha'' has been hospitalized and been psychologically studied, it's pretty much confirmed that not only he can't be rehabilitated into society, his profile is of probable criminal reccurrence. Keeping him alive is a really expensive deal for the local govermment Giving him clothing, adequate alimentation, proper infrastructure and hygiene in the building he's in, qualified therapists, medical aid in case he's physically ill and many other things costs an approximate value of 30,000 . Keep in mind that this is only one example, and there are much more criminals here that cost that much. But why are we doing that? What logical benefit does this have for the society we live in? Nothing. At all. It's a complete waste of resources. ''Champinha'' occasionally is forced into doing community favours such as cleaning up streets, however, such jobs are easily replacable by more qualified personel. Not only there is no benefit into keeping him alive, there are extremely dangerous potential consequences. Wouldn't it be preferable to spend this quantity of money on more relevant issues, such as healthcare and education? Now, I understand that death penalty can be quite expensive as well, America shows us, but that's mostly because there's a excessive quantity of unecessary bureucracy and complicated procedures. Death penalty could be very, VERY cheap if that wasn't on the way. Besides, isn't it better on the long term to spend a big ammount of money ONCE AND FOR ALL instead of progressively, slowly spending a even bigger quantity? For example, a execution in the US costs something like 1.6 million? If you do some maths, this is pretty much what we spend keeping Champinha alive for 5 months. Some people suggested that we don't kill him off, but don't waste money on him either. That means, throwing him into a prison that has no concern for the well being of its prisoners. Well, aside from the obvious ethical and humane implications and issues this has, it doesn't even work Brazil does that with common criminals, and they return to society as even worse delinquents because of their experiences on prison. Overall, death penalty is clearly a logical option for when criminals have no chance of being recovered. Change my view. Unrelated How's my English? gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

Many people note the detrimental effect WalMart has on local business. In my opinion, this is analogous to progress in many spheres of life. As technology grows more powerful, it becomes easier to manufacture cheaper goods, deliver them to more distant places for less money, and offer a wider selection. Any time we make that sort of progress, it is at the cost of people who relied on the old system. In WalMart's case, they displace many mom and pop stores who find it difficult to compete with the giant. Why doesn't Amazon get the kind of hate WalMart does, despite the fact that it must have a similar effect on offline retails and even online ones in many cases ? I feel bad for business owners who have run a friendly hardware store for twenty years, only to file for bankruptcy because people can now buy hammers from WalMart for half the price, but I am prepared to pay that cost for progress. Others cite poor practices with regards to their employees, and I often see comparisons between them and companies like Costco. I think that while WalMart certainly has made mistakes, they receive a disproportionate amount of attention because they are one of the largest employers in the country, and because this fact snowballed into making WalMart a lightning rod for anti corporate interests. Costco pales in comparison to WalMart in terms of size Costco's model would likely be unsustainable at WalMart's scale. WalMart takes advantage of tax loopholes. So do most other corporations their size. The loopholes should be closed. I would take advantage of tax loopholes in my own tax filings if I knew how to find them. WalMart also tries to avoid paying for things like healthcare for their employees. This is an unfortunate aspect of our healthcare systems they rely on employers attracting good employees by offering healthcare, and national healthcare is still mostly a conversation rather than a reality. Considering they are only legally obligated to pay minimum wage, and not offer healthcare at all, I think it's somewhat admirable that the company still manages to provide healthcare for over half a million people over 40 of their US workforce . Does WalMart actually cause more harm than good? Does employing 1.3 million people in a country plagued by unemployment a bad thing? When a municipality allows a WalMart to build despite community protests, shouldn't the municipality receive the blame rather than WalMart itself?

Some of these people have had good futures ahead of them, did well in school, had lots of friends but as soon as they tried weed for the first time they formed a mental addiction and would smoke it every single day.

I'm going to sketch my version of egoism, based largely on Ayn Rand's ethics, and then deal with some common objections to it. Part 1 Egoism Before we can discuss morality, we have to discuss the nature of values. Something's being a value to someone presupposes a goal and an alternative faced in pursuit of that goal. For example, a house is a value to someone because they have the goal of acquiring shelter and, facing the alternative of getting a house or not having shelter, have chosen to get a house. The fundamental alternative, which gives meaning to all of the others, is the alternative of life and death. Therefore, the only context in which it makes sense to talk about something being of value to someone is a context in which they are struggling to live in some way and the value in question aids them in their pursuit of life. Every organism is confronted with values and disvalues. For example, to a tree, fertile soil is a value, and rocky soil is a disvalue. To a lion, catching a gazelle is a value, and going hungry is a disvalue. Every type of organism has a means of survival that, under suitable conditions, allows it to acquire its values. Plants automatically put down roots and grow leaves. Non human animals, higher on the scale, have consciousness in the form of instincts which tell them what to do automatically. However, non human organisms do not have moral values. What makes humans able to have moral values, but not other organisms? The fact that human beings have the ability to reason, which is the human means of survival. Human beings, unlike other animals, do not automatically know what to do. They have to develop a system of principles that will tell them how to achieve those things that they value, i.e., a moral code. Since this is the only legitimate purpose of morality, moral codes can be assessed by whether or not they are conducive to man's life, i.e., the life of the actor. In practice, this moral standard leads to a morality based on the virtues of rationality, productivity, and pride. Rationality means using one's mind to one's fullest ability in pursuit of one's values and eschewing evasion on any subject. Productivity means acknowledging that you have to work to live and creating the physical values that your life requires. Pride means always trying to improve yourself morally until you are perfect. These three virtues lead to an upward spiral, where rationality tells you what goals to pursue, productivity allows you to pursue the goals, and the pride you earn thereby encourages you to seek out new and higher challenges to your mind. Part 2 Objections Probably the most common misconception about egoism is that it would lead us to lie, cheat and steal whenever we can get away with it. This is not true, because a rational egoist will acknowledge that reality is an integrated whole where everything bears on everything else. You can never count on getting away with lying, cheating or stealing, because your deception will be contrary to reality, which means that there will be innumerable facts that will tend to give you away, creating significant risk whether the other person finds those facts or not. Even if you get away with your lie or theft, it will change you, creating a precedent in your mind for more lying, cheating or stealing in the future, and who knows if you will get caught then ? If we are looking at reality and not evading it, then it is clear that we should adopt honesty as a principle that we always adhere to. There is an exception to this in the case where Nazis are knocking on the door asking if you are hiding Jews in your basement, but such cases are very rare. Another, related objection asks what an egoist would do if they were stuck in the middle of the ocean with another person on a life raft that could only hold one. The answer to this is that morality only applies to cases where long term survival is possible in cases where long term survival is not possible, life boat scenarios, no moral principles apply. This is because the purpose of morality is to tell us how to live, not to deal with bizarre cases that almost never occur, and a morality that could deal with all conceivable cases would be so abstract as to be useless. So, there is no rule about what an egoist has to do in a life boat scenario in the scenario I just described, one could either let the other person on the life raft and allow oneself to drown, or one could fight the other person off to preserve one's own life. Neither choice is open to moral evaluation. To change my view about this, you must give a convincing objection to the argument for egoism in Part 1. Your case will be more convincing if you also provide a more compelling argument for a non egoist morality."}, {"conclusion": "It is wrong to call our civil law system as justice.", "id": 5768, "argument": "If by omnipotence we mean a being who can do any logically possible thing, but not break the laws of logic, it is possible to remain all-good while also willing God's existence.

If I'm correct, it doesn't make me want to reject my egalitarian political beliefs, but it does make me feel a little uncomfortable about the heritability of socially valued traits liked intelligence, and the effect that this might have on unequal outcomes between racial groups. To be clear, I'm not suggesting environment plays no role in the gap. In fact, I'm relatively agnostic about how much of the gap should be explained by heritable vs. environmental factors. What I'm skeptical of is the position that heritable factors play no role or a very small, negligible one in the racial IQ gap. Here's why I currently take this position There are well documented, persisting IQ gaps between African and non African populations around the world. Even papers skeptical of hereditarian theories of IQ have acknowledged these gaps between Sub Saharan African countries and non African countries. The gaps have also continued for decades within countries like America that have large African diaspora populations. Many of the strong, evidence based arguments against the idea that these gaps are totally or almost entirely explained by environmental factors like culture, socioeconomics, and bias in IQ testing are explained in this paper which examined 30 years of academic research on the race and intelligence debate. Among other evidence, twin studies like this one cast significant doubt on the nurture only race and IQ position. Although this study had some problems like a small sample size, twin studies are regarded by psychologists as having a great deal of predictive power because they help researchers control for heritable factors like genes. Even controversial hereditarian academics like Arthur Jensen have rejected the biological determinist position that IQ is completely determined by heritable factors. They acknowledge that such gaps have an environmental component, although they think the gap is mostly explained by heritable factors. This is contrasted with many social scientists Richard Nisbett, James R. Flynn, Joshua Aronson, Diane Halpern, William Dickens, Eric Turkheimer, etc. on the nurture side of the debate that take an environmental determinist position and frequently reject that biological factors play any role. Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker makes a strong case for this general trend in academic nature nurture debates in his book The Blank Slate. To me, it seems that the hereditarian interactionist camp in the race and IQ debate not only has more convincing evidence, but is taking a less biased, more intellectually modest approach. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators.

If I imagine myself believing in a god and identifying with a certain organised religion with a holy book I think I'd be really alert and careful about following all of the rules in that book. In most monotheistic religions you're actually talking about an omnipotent and omnipresent being who judges your every move and can punish you for eternity in the afterlife. If I was religious I'd be scared shitless I don't quite understand how so many religious people can act so nonchalantly about their faith. For example, the Quran supposedly is made up of the exact words of God. How can a self respecting muslim justify picking and choosing which verses to follow? How can a modern muslim claim to be against men hitting women when their holy book explicitly allows this? Surely the exact words of a God that has the power to inflict eternal suffering on you and all you loved ones are no laughing matter and should not be taken lightly. Aren't you implying that God is imperfect when you willingly ignore certain verses? Of course everyone has the right to exercise their religion in whichever way they choose but I feel like you are being intellectually unfair when you consider certain aspects of a holy book more important than others. That obviously means that you can put your whole religion in a certain perspective and be somewhat critical about it, so why still follow the other rules? You obviously believe that you can get away with ignoring some of God's words, so why not go all the way and stop following that religion as a whole? Either God is perfect and you follow his every word or he is imperfect and has no authority to make rules about your life.

I'm not part of the trans community myself. I'm also not really a social justice type and I don't call myself a feminist, which probably separates me from most people who make this claim, and I often see them arguing for this quite poorly. I think there's a valid version of this claim that can be advanced, and I'll see if I can do it here. It's not intention to shame anyone into dating having sex with trans people. I just think I have a case that many might not have considered. To make a few things clear You're probably not going to change my view if you suppose that trans men women aren't really men women. That's a discussion we could have but I'd rather just take it as a given that trans men are men and trans women are women for the sake of this post. With that in mind, I'm defining transphobic as having an unreasonable prejudice toward transness or trans people. We can disagree on that definition as well, but I'd like to keep discussions about semantics to a minimum. You can substitute my definition in for the word in the title if you'd like. I'm not talking about rejecting trans people as sexual dating possibilities because they don't pass very well or because of what genitals they have, since those are valid reason in my mind. I'm also not talking about rejection of individual trans people. I'm talking about a categorical rejection of trans people as a group in this context. A few responses I anticipate It's just a preference. Are straight people homophobic? If it is a preference, it's a preference that can only come from transphobia. The difference between not being attracted to a particular gender and not being attracted to trans people can not be understated because exclusive attraction to a people of a particular gender is based soley on that gender's appearance, character, behavior, etc. e.g. we don't DNA tests of potential partners , and there are trans people who, in these ways, are indistinguishable from people of the gender they identify as. The only way to create a distinction between cis and trans people in the context of sex dating is the transness itself, which I don't think fits into any reasonable calculus of attraction. I want a partner who I can make children with. This might be valid, but I don't think most of the people who reject trans people are actually concerned about this. If you're one of these people, consider if this is actually a factor in your psychology with regard to this issue, or a post hoc justification. If it is, I'd like to propose a thought experiment in which medical technology has advanced to the point that allows trans people to produce offspring obviously, it's impossible for trans men to have male children with female partners, but let's set that aside for now, I don't anticipate that actually being an important factor . I'm just not attracted to trans people. It's a part of my psychology that is just there. Now, this view seems to make sense at first, but it falls apart when you consider that while perhaps difficult to modify, such a feature of one's psychology can only come from an implicit bias against trans people e.g. I'm a straight male and I'm not attracted to men, and trans women are men to a degree. Now you could be a progressive, accepting person who doesn't say or even consciously think this, but if you're not attracted to somebody on the basis of their transness, such a bias is clearly present at some level of your psychology. To take a simple analogy you meet a woman and you find her perfect in every way until you find out that she's Jewish. Does it not at least indicate latent anti Semetic biases if this a boner killer? So it is too with trans people. That's all for now. I'll be back in a few hours to respond to the most compelling or infuriating counterpoints. Happy hunting EDIT I'll be back in a few hours to respond to comments and give out deltas if they're well earned. Maybe my position was poorly laid out and people have pointed out some issues, here it is in one sentence, slightly amended it is transphobic to reject a trans person solely on the basis of being trans . If having children is part of your calculus, it wouldn't be transphobic to reject trans people as long as you also reject sterile people. So for the purposes of this post, I'm talking about post op trans people and assuming that children are not a concern. I will not be giving deltas to people who just parrot one of my anticipated responses, nor to anyone who rejects my view because they don't think trans people are legit.

See for example and there is even an example of the usual Drama that ensues including buzzwords like meritocracy . On the one hand, I strongly believe in women's rights. On the other, I think that the group of people that thinks there should be a lot more women as writers and as characters preferably to them 50 , is wrong on an important point. But maybe you can . First, to be clear, what I mean by fantasy here is classical fantasy, stuff like Tolkien and everything influenced by those works. There is plenty of excellent fantasy that is not classical , but I'm not talking about that here partly because I like the classical genre, and because r fantasy mostly focuses on the classical stuff as well . Two examples Game of Thrones is classical fantasy, Twilight is not. My argument is this Fantasy again, classical fantasy has been defined by high fantasy such as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and sword and sorcery fantasy such as Howard's Conan. Fantasy today is a large field, but still heavily influenced by those origins. In particular, fantasy takes place in a medieval like setting, and often involves combat and the military. The Lord of the Rings is in large part the story of a military struggle between two great powers, and combat was seen frequently along the way Conan has even more combat but less of a military aspect, except for some specific stories etc. Medieval settings are patriarchal societies are generally led by male kings, male religious authorities, etc., there are legal restrictions on women, etc. . The middle ages simply were that way historically, and therefore the default for a fantasy setting is patriarchal as well. There is still plenty of room for interesting female characters there, but they will be the exception, not the rule. Military settings in such times are even more male oriented. Armies have throughout history been almost entirely male in part perhaps due to those societies being patriarchal, but also because of biological facts about our species . Again, interesting female characters are still very possible, but a story about the military will have such characters as an exception. Of course, there is nothing wrong with not writing about a medieval setting just don't write classical fantasy . Also nothing wrong about having a medieval setting that breaks the rules and ignores history and or biology, for example, Erickson and Donaldson are popular writers whose fantasy settings are downright feminist in terms of female representation in the military. And we are talking about fantasy here, where dragons and magic exist, so breaking some expectations of reality is normal. Still, every such change is something that the author and the readers need to adjust for, and diverts focus. For example, in Erickson's works the military is 100 egalitarian and has a 50 50 gender split, even among first line fighters heavies , but women are still physically smaller and weaker than men as in our world , which makes it a little puzzling until you learn to just ignore that aspect. Gender isn't special here, of course A fantasy world in which water is red is of course possible, but unless there is a good reason for that, generally even in fantasy worlds the water looks the same as in ours. Similarly, generally in medieval fantasy worlds society is patriarchal and especially so the military. This is of course limited to classical fantasy. More general fantasy, like Harry Potter, etc., and Twilight and other vampire themed works , etc. take place in our modern egalitarian society, and have built in reasons for equality of the sexes anyone can be a wizard or vampire, to limit it to one gender would in fact be a surprising break of expectations and the power granted by being a wizard or vampire dwarfs the general male physical power advantage . I think it is very reasonable to expect to see a large proportion of women both as authors and as characters in such genres. And in fact female authors are very prominent there. Perhaps classical fantasy will decline in popularity over time. But it appears to be very popular right now Game of Thrones, for example , and medieval and military settings are traditional in that genre, and do not favor female characters. And a field focused on male characters might unsurprisingly have a negative effect on attracting female authors although of course many of the best male characters in fantasy have been written by female authors, like Hobb, Le Guin, etc., gender does not limit what one can write about . In summary, I don't think we can say there is anything wrong with the low of women in fantasy. Of course the field should not push women away, it should do the opposite. But we have to be realistic no pun intended , a genre focused on medieval and military settings is likely going to continue to have more men in it. And Twilight might continue to have more female fans. And both of those are fine."}, {"conclusion": "Private schools preserve traditions that are absent, or otherwise impractical to maintain, in the state system.", "id": 13983, "argument": "Some past times are preserved and encouraged disproportionately at private schools.

Though everyone is obviously invited to debate without me. When it comes to eSports there are often discussions if it is a real Sport. Now this shouldnt be a post arguing if eSport are real sports, instead I propose the following Any clear definition of sport that does not rely on exeptions and instead has some precise axioms that determain whether an activity is a sport or not either includes eSports or exlude many traditional sports. Or to have another formularion there is nothing no attribute that excludes eSports, and only eSports, from traditional sports that would make it not a sport. An Example A common definition of sports is that it is a physical activity that is done to compete with others. Now this is a very usefull definition, however, physical isnt defined yet, and I think thats the point where a lot of disagreement starts to happen. physical can be a very broad term. MW simply says gt phys\u00b7i\u00b7cal adjective \u02c8fi zi k\u0259l gt relating to the body of a person instead of the mind relating to the body is a very wide category. If we look at it from a sport stanpoint it can mean a lot of things your endurance, your reaction time , your motor skills gross fine or just raw muscular power. Now if you have the widest definition of physical that includes all of the above, you have a sport definition that includes all traditional sports , such as motorsport, ball sports, horse racing, equestrianism, shooting, archery, snooker, dart and so on. eSports also fall clearly in this definition, because they require very good reaction times and high fine motor skills. And we could start to reduce the definition of physical . E.g. only gross motor skills are allowed. But that would disqualify weightlifting, shooting, motorsports, dart, snooker and so on. Ok, lets say its physical demanding aka endurance and the muscular power you have. Ok, now weightlifting and rowing is included, but a lot of other sports shooting, darts, snooker etc.pp. still isnt. It also introduce a very vague definition. Are the G Forces you experience in motorsport enough for this definition ? What about curling ? Archery ? Horse racing and equestrianism ? Why, why not ? And so on. If you have an axiom that excludes eSport, the very same definition also excludes other sports. It is impossible to find something that would exclude eSports as a real sport that doesnt also exclude other traditional sports and or is very vague. What I explicitly not want is that you try to argue that eSports isnt a real sport. Its very easy to find a sport definition that exludes eSports, as shown above."}, {"conclusion": "I think that if a job requires higher education, the company should be required to fund said education.", "id": 122062, "argument": "As a college student struggling financially to get through college just to get a job that will support myself, it occurred to me recently that instead of students going into debt, or higher education being government funded, like primary education is, businesses who require a degree should be required to help a student achieve that degree.

For people who wish to continue this conversation, I will specify that I will provide a Delta to a person who can show, with evidence, any of the following. A ERPOs require a similar or higher level of proof to other orders which infringe on a person's rights e.g. restraining order. B The person subject to an ERPO has the opportunity to represent themselves in court before the order it is decided and executed. C An ERPO is, both in theory and in practice, a temporary restriction D On appealing an ERPO, the defendant does not require the burden of proof to prove themselves innocent or not a threat. In the United States, there has been increasing discussion about red flag gun laws in an attempt to prevent mass shootings, and President Donald Trump recently came out in support of such laws. Red Flag laws allow authorities to confiscate a person's firearms using an extreme risk protection order ERPO if a relative or someone else believes the person is a threat to themselves or others. Whatever your position is on guns and the Second Amendment, these laws are unethical because they are against the principle of due process. They do not require any professional proof that the person has mental illness, and the person does not have a chance to defend themselves in court before they have their firearms taken. Red Flag reports could be abused by other citizens, who may have a grudge against someone or want to do them harm, and want the police to disarm them. There is also the potential for government abuse, and Red Flag laws could lead to the weakening of constitutional protections in areas unrelated to gun rights. Edit I should clarify what I said here. I did not mean that Red Flag laws can directly be used for infringements of civil liberties in other areas, but that they will be used for a precedent for further weakening of constitutional protections, i.e., they will say, If we take away rights with Red Flag laws, why can't we do it with X or Y law? I admit that this argument is contingent upon the premise that Red Flag laws themselves do actually infringe on civil liberties, so maybe it was redundant to include in the post. The U.S. already has legal methods of taking guns away from criminals or people with serious psychological issues, so ERPOs, with their drawbacks, are unnecessary."}, {"conclusion": "Hearthstone is an objectively bad Card Game.", "id": 119231, "argument": "I have many personal reasons why I don't like hearthstone, I dont believe significant amounts of RNG belong in a game, and I do think that that's one of the factors that makes it a bad game. Though I can understand the appeal to make it more casual fun focused why they embrace competitive play when they have cards purely relying on RNG is beyond me. The goal in MOST competitive card games is to make consistent decks that work no matter what you draw, as well as 'deck fixing' by guaranteeing you get certain things. Cards like Burnished Hart from MTG being an example how how a game employs fixing. You can also employ fixing in your own deck by putting more of a card, or specific type of card in your deck, and thereby reducing the extent to which RNG influences your games. So ultimately, card games are not about the RNG in the sense that we should embrace it, but in the sense that a good deck doesn't care about RNG. Especially over a set of 3 games. My biggest gripe with hearthstone is the fact that the game just doesn't work. Card effects that seem like they should work together dont, and card effects that seem like they shouldn't work together do. The word draw means different things on different cards and the order selection of triggered effects may as well be random for how much control you have over it. I don't really think you can call your game good when it doesn't even interact in ways that make sense based on card text or scenario, a lot of this comes down to thoughtless coding, no doubt, but it's a big deal and doesn't really make any sense to me."}, {"conclusion": "The nature of their job means that Supreme Court Justices have to keep in touch with the country's large political and social trends.", "id": 54809, "argument": "Supreme Court Justices often have to read Amicus briefs from experts on the issues relevant to the case they are deciding.

For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out. So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other.

To me not a cyclist the first option is preferable, because I view the roadway as being intended for motor vehicles only. I believe it is far less safe to put bikes in the road than it is to put them on the sidewalk. A car moving at 30 mph has WAY more momentum than a bike going top speed, and while a bike hitting a pedestrian may injure the pedestrian or the cyclist, a car hitting a bike could kill the rider.

I typically am outraged when companies censor people's views, and hate when celebrities try to force diversity into their movies, especially when they try to target white males. However, I find this situation to be different. x200B So first of all people are apparently angry about Brie Larson being in Captain Marvel because of controversial things she said. Originally I figured these people were justified in their outrage. This is because political Youtube channels that I typically agree with such as TheQuartering and NoBullshit were posting videos with thumbnails that suggested Brie Larson had done said something racist and sexist. I never watched these videos, but I pretty much always agree with TheQuartering and typically agree with NoBullshit not always though . After seeing the movie more on that later , I decided to find out what she actually said. Some people are angry over her saying something along the lines of A Wrinkle in Time wasn't made for white men. Now on the surface this could seem problematic, but if you actually see what the movie is about, you'd know that it isn't. The cast of A Wrinkle in Time is almost entirely black women. Coupling this with the fact that not all movies are made for everyone should point you to what she was getting at. She wasn't being racist, or sexist. She was just saying that the demographic was not white men, and was instead black women. There is no problem with that. x200B The other complaint I see is how Marvel made the marketing more about how Captain Marvel is a women, instead of showing off the movie itself. I can see how this bothers some people, but I don't see how this is Brie Larson's fault. She isn't in charge of Marvel's marketing. x200B These complaints led to absolutely trash reviews for Captain Marvel, most of them coming from people who hadn't even seen the movie yet. Many reviews were calling Brie Larson an SJW idiot and other crap like that, and said absolutely nothing about the movie. Other reviews appeared to be people trying to say something about the movie was bad, just to hide their hate for Brie Larson. One review said Brie Larson is a dull and terrible actor. It would have been a great movie with a better leading actor. This seems like it could possibly be a real review, but after seeing the movie I can't help but think the person is just trying to bash the movie because of their hate for Larson. Brie Larson was definitely not dull. You could easily say Captain Marvel as a character wasn't great, but Larson did well with the script she was given. x200B These reviews led Rotten Tomatoes, Disney, and other review websites to decide to wipe over 50,000 reviews, which boosted the rating of the movie. I don't see a problem with this at all. Why wouldn't a company wipe obviously fake reviews from people who haven't even seen the movie? I go onto Rotten Tomatoes to see if a movie is good or not, not to hear people's opinions about an actor. I see other people who wrote legitimate bad reviews getting angry about them being removed. This sucks, but it can't be helped. Do they actually expect people to go through and 1 by 1 remove 50,000 reviews? They most likely had a bot going through all of them, and some actual reviews got purged by accident. x200B I do not believe this is all some plot by Disney to make a crappy movie look better than it is. I think they are just trying to give their movie a fair chance. x200B It was a decently good movie btw"}, {"conclusion": "Some Degree Gender-Based Expectations Are Healthy For Society And Relationships", "id": 20975, "argument": "I firmly believe men and women have evolved to be natural counterparts, each fulfilling different roles in the natural process of their, and their offspring's, life span. As technology has grown, we have become able to shed these natural roles e.g. women are now as good as providers as men despite their physical inferiority men are more capable of caring for young children with the advent of breast milk alternatives . However, this has come at a great cost. As time goes it seems men and women are, rather than working in synergy to become greater than the sum of their parts, in direct competition with one another. The reason and merit for this change is outside of the scope of this post. However, it is hard to argue against the existence of that circumstance. What is within the purview of this post is that the destruction of gender roles is to blame for this deterioration of relationships. I disagree with the mainstream view that gender roles are oppressive to women and both genders really . In my view, gender roles serve an important societal purpose in that they set the basic expectations for men and women when it comes to interacting with one another. In fact I believe the modern day destruction and demonization of gender roles in western society is partly, if not chiefly, to blame for the rise in divorce rates, decline in marriage rates, and the decline in reproduction throughout the western world. As we strip away societal expectations individuals in relationships lose grasp of what they should expect from their partner. This results in unrealistic expectations, uncertainty regarding an individual's role in life, and resulting massive dissatisfaction by all parties involved. It causes people to become more selfish and hedonistic because they do not have society reinforcing within them the virtues of raising and providing for a family. This leads to the destruction of long term relationships and the family unit as a whole. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this will result in the end of such societies due to declining birth rates.

Good for Body Image The main reason people don't wear speedos in my experience is because they are embarrassed about their image don't feel comfortable in them. I think that's really sad. Where I grew up speedos were compulsory and no one gave a toss because they were used to it. I think that's a much better attitude to have. To be honest, given all these points I don't know why anyone would want ever want to wear board shorts. I challenge you to persuade me speedos aren't superior BTW I'm not arguing that speedos are better on the beach.

Action Points I get the reasoning behind them but they limit what I want to do so badly I want to throw my computer out the window. They simply seem unrealistic. Enemies Perhaps it's because I never played long enough to get better equipment, but every time I play and try to attack I always miss at point blank range. However at 100 yards the enemy seems to be a dead eye with every shot. Turns Things will happen to my guys on an enemy turn that I can't react to like I would in Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, etc and it seems unrealistic.

But it could have happened in a split second, far to fast for me to react, and that doesn't bother me because shit happens like that IRW all the time.

Now I'm not quite sure about the logic, but my interpretation of this is that Superman's power is too much to allow any one person being to have. Zod was an example of that same power in control of a more malicious figure. It seems the only justification for Superman is that he's a good guy. But that perspective seems naive. Relying on Superman's sense of right wrong means that the human race is completely reliant on Superman's perspective. I could compare it to the Marvel universe. Captain America is a good guy, with a strong sense of right and wrong. And he was as devoted to the United States as anyone, being an officer of the US Army and working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. But in Civil War the comic series, since the movie appears to not be quite so drastic , Cap literally wages war against the United States government because he disagrees with a single piece of legislation. What happens if this were to take place in the DCCU? What if Superman decides that a law passed by the US or any country is fundamentally wrong? He literally has the power to kill any person he may decide to. He could launch a one man civil war against the entire human race if his subjective sense of morality told him it was the right thing to do. That kind of power is not something that humans should accept. If it's within the power of humanity or one human, such as Batman Bruce Wayne , there is absolutely a reason to strip Superman of his power, or even kill him if there's no alternative. Arguments that won't persuade me Batman is a hypocrite This may very well be. But his power is completely within the realm of humanity. He's a good fighter with a lot of technology and resources, but he can't single handedly inflict the same kind of damage to the world that Superman could. And besides that, just because Bruce Wayne is a hypocrite doesn't mean he's wrong . It would be more conducive to develop a foil to Superman to use as a last resort rather than try to fight him and potentially inflict tons of collateral damage This isn't necessarily a bad argument, but the only sort of technology that may exist to stop Superman would be a reactionary Mutually Assured Destruction plan. It does nothing to prevent, and once this technology is developed, it could be used or imitated by countless other humans for nefarious purposes."}, {"conclusion": "Evading censorship is already possible and censorship does not prevent the use of the internet.", "id": 102645, "argument": "Proposition itself concedes that authoritarian states in the vast majority of cases are unlikely to cut off access to the internet for their population entirely.

However, the alternative that many on the left are calling for is to have a completely popular vote. There are multiple problems with this Ease of rigging I can win the popular vote simply by rigging a handful of population centers, the current system only allows you to win so many votes from rigging, as the electoral vote decentralizes where points come from. Ease of voting Denser population clusters have an easier time voting because the distance to the nearest voting center is usually less. Also, some states make voting easier than others with mail in ballots and early voting. Furthermore, rules from state to state differ, like voting ID requirements. Politician's focus Should the popular vote be enacted, all focus would turn from swing states to the areas with the highest populations. While potentially better than the current swing state focus, it is not ideal to have a huge portion of the population ignored simply because they are more dispersed. State's Rights Not necessarily the biggest issue, but states having their own rights is an important issue, and when you move to a completely popular vote, it's likely that the views of larger states begin to be federalized, trampling on those of smaller states. So, my proposal is a bit of a marriage of the two systems, and I've tried to find a problem with it, and would like to know if any of you can show where it would fail. Ranked Voting Not really related, but I'd love to change this simultaneously, rather than voting for a single candidate, the past the post system, you rank candidates, and if your vote goes to the highest ranked candidate on your list depending on who it comes down to in the end. This allows for 3rd parties to have a shot, without voters feeling they are throwing away their vote. Largely reduces the lesser of two evils issue in Politics. Dynamic Electoral Vote Counts Assign Electoral Votes after each census according to population, with no fixed number of Electoral Votes. Essentially you could have every 100 or 1000 people equal 1 electoral vote. This removes the issue of a vote in California not being worth the same as one in a smaller state. Popular Electoral Vote Assignment Assign electoral votes as a percentage of the vote, rather than the winner take all system. That way every vote counts, and states like New York, where the Rural areas are almost entirely Republican, but always go blue thanks to the cities, vote reflecting their own inner diversity. Split Electoral Votes by Counties, rather than by State Because of the Ease of voting issues mentioned regarding the popular vote, the electoral votes within a state would be assigned by popular vote, but each county would get a share of electoral votes, to prevent high turnout in one county from blowing out the votes of counties with lower turnout. This share would be based on county population, so denser populated counties would have a larger number of votes, reflecting their population. And that's it I've thought a lot about it, and I feel like this avoids the tyranny of the masses, while giving every person an equal voice. Tell me why my system wouldn't work. EDIT I should clarify Under my system, not every person's vote will be equal, as people voting in areas with lower voter turnout will be able to vote with the weight of those who chose not to. Every person will have equal voting weight, regardless of whether or not they choose to vote. Should they choose not to vote, their voting power is essentially given to their neighbors within their own county. I consider this to be a better representation of each individual's beliefs than essential giving up voting power compared to counties that have higher voting turnout."}, {"conclusion": "Reddit is broken, and most users not users do not care.", "id": 35650, "argument": "First of all, I do love reddit.

The first is that 'Peer review' the checking of scientific test results by fellow scientists is often made impossible by the unwillingness of biotechnology companies to give up their results for review.1 Furthermore, government agencies are often unwilling to stop GM foodstuffs reaching the shelf because of the clout that the companies have with their government. So in regards to research, there have not yet been unbiased findings showing that GMO crops are safe. It is true, that in the US, there have been no adverse consequences from over 500 field releases in the United States. U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA evaluated in 1993 data on genetically modified organisms regarding safety claims. The Union of Concerned Scientists UCS believes that the USDA evaluation was too small scale, to actually asses the risks. Also many reports also failed to mention or even measure any environmental risks connected with GM food commercialisation.2 Also, there are a number of dangers associated with the food itself, even without scientific evaluations. For example, the addition of nut proteins to soybeans caused those with nut allergies to go into shock upon eating the soybeans. Although this was detected in testing, sooner or later a transferred gene will cause risk to human health because the scientists did not conceive it could be a problem.3 This will become a greater problem as more modifications are introduced. There are also possible dangers associated with the scientific technique itself by which the DNA is modified, an example is the spread of antibiotic resistance. 1 Pusztai A., Genetically modified foods: Are they a risk to Human/Animal Health ?, published June 2001, accessed 09/02/2011 2 Shah A., Is GE food safe ?, Global Issues, accessed 09/02/2011 3European Federation of Biotechnology, Allergies from GM food, published September 2000, accessed 09/02/2011"}, {"conclusion": "IMDB is the most reliable indicator of movie quality", "id": 123178, "argument": "Rotten Tomatoes, Flixter and others seem to vary in their accuracy.

I actually had come about this belief about 15 years ago, while talking to my therapist about my depression. I didn't quite have the same words to describe it, but I definitely could tell it existed since my living situation with my parents constantly shifted. No matter how good or bad it got, I quickly returned to the same base level of happiness. Nowadays I still have personal goals, but some of them involve things outside my control. For instance, finding a romantic partner or becoming wealthy would certainly make me happy. But I would quickly return to baseline after having achieved those goals or having not achieved those goals . Because of this, I no longer chase after happiness but chase after concrete goals like health, wealth as a store of resources , available social networks as a store of human capital , with the ultimate goal to live as long as possible.

My reasoning is this If it was agreed to 76\u00b0F, then the opposing party would need to get more naked to feel less hot. This would require that individual to stay in private quarters if they are uncomfortable with wearing less clothing in front of the other party or even some potential guests. This also means that if the opposing party is completely naked, yet still warm, he she cannot get any more naked to achieve a comfortable body temperature. But, if the parties agreed to 72\u00b0F, then the opposite party would only have to wear a little more clothing to remain warm. This will allow that party to maintain decency in the presence of others, and he she is able to add on more layers of clothing to reach their comfortable body temperature. If the range of temperatures is too wide, like 65\u00b0F and 85\u00b0F, then they should probably not be roommates unless they are forced to, and that may be a different circumstance requiring different ideas. Therefore, currently, this view is only applicable to reasonable temperature differences like the aforementioned. This view also assumes that one of the parties has enough outerwear to make up for the lower temperature experienced. If this is not the case, and clothing is limited, then the view is susceptible to adjustment.

The first task of any politician is to ensure that existing policies, the promise a democratic government has made to its people, will be carried out. A government that says it's OK to choose to not to enforce policies that it did not even bother to change, is an abjectly dysfunctional government that is not worthy of any measure of respect. When this happens, policies become much much harder to enact. It's OK if changes in policy happen slowly but, but it's getting to a point where this gridlock is hurting the country. Secondly, a government shutdown when it does occur is bad for the economy. No, the damage is not super great, but there are billions of dollars that are getting removed from the economy for completely wanton and pointless reasons. There is no reason why benefits administrators working for a sovereign power that controls the monetary system can't keep working.

I think they are the shittiest creatures on this planet and if I had a time machine I would almost certainly do my best to make sure they were never adopted as pets. Now for a long time I was impartial to the ownership of cats, it did not really bother me, but a month or so back some of our neighbours got one. Since that happened it has been giving us hell. The damn thing keeps stealing food from our house, scratching furniture and coming home at night to find a cat on your bed if you happen to be allergic to them is the worst thing ever. So, why don't I just keep my house closed you might ask? Well I live in South Africa and due to the expense of air conditioning we primarily cool our house by leaving windows and doors open. Additionally I do not see why we should be forced to change our lifestyle so the neighbours can own a cat. Basically I feel cat ownership should be illegal mainly as it negatively impacts the lives of other people in your community forcing them to adapt to your cat. Additionally cats do a great deal of damage to the local environment by killing many small birds and reptiles. For example we had chameleons in our yard for quite some time and they were awesome, but then our neighbour's cat killed them all. Now I know there are probably people who somehow manage to keep their cats confined to their house or yard somehow and I have no issue with these people. Let them be able to apply for a cat ownership license and be subject to a fine if their cat happens to wander into your yard. Edit Additionally I found that the region where I live has legislature that it is illegal if dogs are not properly and adequately fenced to keep such a dog inside when it is not on a leash, unless the dog is confined to the premises in some other manner . In essence I feel this law should apply to cats as well. 2nd edit View has been changed by stevegcook. The fact that cats can be kept indoors means that legislation holding cat owners responsible for their cats is feasible.

If you recall, we were once a confederacy with a weak central government, and the South wanted to remain a confederacy to keep slavery and that caused the civil war. Federations, on the other hand, have strong federal governments with some power to override the legislative actions of individual states. The US runs on a system that is too much of a compromise. On one hand, Roe v Wade has been the law of the entire United States since 1973, guaranteeing a constitutional right to abortions up to a certain point in pregnancy. On the other hand, state implementation of Roe v Wade compliance led to disparity in abortion access between liberal and conservative states, and also between socioeconomic classes and races. On one hand, there is the fact that we have a supreme court ruling from many years ago, and the majority of the people, based on most polling, believes at least some abortions should be legal. On the other hand, one of the least educated, most religious, and brightest red southern states and another southern state just sent the whole country into a constitutional crisis. So what's likely to happen now are lawsuits in Alabama and Georgia that will most likely get sent to the US Supreme Court. The stacked conservative supreme court, the one stacked after Mitch McConnell illegally prevented Obama from appointing a judge and then prevented Democrats from sufficient oversight during Trump's nominations, will likely wind up restricting abortion access at the federal level, effectively overturning 46 year old precedent. So the legislative actions of a portion of the population from 2 50 states might restrict access to abortions in places where there was no debate about whether or not to allow them. There will be much more heavily regulated abortion services in places that have already democratically decided to allow them. Alabama and Georgia have abused our federalist system to potentially force the whole country to follow their beliefs. It doesn't make sense that ~11ish million people can set the rules for ~190 210 million or more that are in favor of allowing at least some abortions. EDIT I understand that this could only happen with pro life legislation at the federal level, and not just with the overturning of Roe. Overturning Roe, however, will allow the federal legislature to do so. Either a true federation or true confederacy would be better for abortion laws. Under a true confederacy, the central government would probably be too weak or simply not even allowed to enforce abortion laws in individual states, allowing liberal states to decide for themselves whether or not to allow abortion all under a similar interstate commerce act that prevents persecutions of those who received treatment in another state. But since the US is not going to be a confederacy again, per the constitution, we need to rethink our government and shift our legislative and electoral systems to a much more democratic one. Giving the people power over states is important. Clearly, the people of the united states do not want this. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 and pro choice Democrats made huge ground retaking the majority in the House. The senate is bullshit because it gives Wyoming's less than 600,000 residents the same power as California's 40 million. I'm all about preventing tyranny of the majority when it's appropriate. A slight majority should not always be able to legislatively bully and disregard the desires of a slight minority. However, The United State's unwillingness to create a central, democratically chosen power structure, favoring states over the people, has directly led to a legal expression of conservative values that does not reflect how many people think that way. It's hypocritical that we value individualism while forcing everyone to think in groups called states and districts."}, {"conclusion": "Significantly more women than men are graduating from high schools and universities.", "id": 122180, "argument": "In 2016, 57.0% of all graduates in the European Union of a Master or equivalent degree, were women."}, {"conclusion": "If time travel was possible, we would never be able to change the past, and no paradoxes could happen.", "id": 94418, "argument": "With time travel, you are traveling through time as though it was space.

It is like taking the film of a movie and laying it out on the ground. You can see everything at the same place. Now, if a typically paradoxical situation arose, such as meeting your future self, there would be no problem. Meeting your future self would mean that whether or not you want to, you know that at some point in the future you will be traveling back in time to meet yourself. However, this does not remove free will. People can still choose individual points in their lives, in the same way that you know for a fact that whether or not you want to, you will die at some point in the future. Take, for example, the Grandfather paradox. In pop culture time travel back to the future, doctor who, ect. going back in time to kill your grandfather would cause massive ripples through time, and you would not exist, stuck in a paradox. With that version, time travel is not possible. However, with realistic time travel, you can never kill your grandfather. If you ever try, you will fail. You will not manage to kill him, you'll miss your desired destination with your time machine, so on and so forth. All of this already happened, so nothing you do changes the future.

As argued above, DRM allows overpricing. Sony and EMI have recognised this in China, where to combat DVD and VCD piracy they have cut DRM spending and now sell their VCDs for around $2. As a result, they can now compete on price with the pirates, people pay a small amount more for a genuine version, and EMI have doubled their profits in the VCD market since 2005, almost all attributable to increased sales. For domestic users, DRM makes it so difficult to manage your media i.e. if you lose your hard disc then you lose all of the itunes that you've paid to download that it actually creates a positive incentive to download pirate mp3s rather than legitimate itunes songs.

But most of the time I watch a movie or a TV show of this subject, my cynicism is always nagging me. Ofcourse it's fiction, and creative liberty can be taken, and I am obviously willing to accept some compromises in realism, proportionate to how much fantasy is involved. But in most 28 Days Later, The Walking Dead, World War Z, and so on, it's just too much for me to swallow. First off, I'm fairly loose on the definition of traditional animalistic husks of people, be it actually undead, or still alive but acting as a vector for disease, whether they can run, are limited to a slow walk, or even swim, has no impact in how I would see the outcome. My only major stipulation is that the disease is spread physically from infected to uninfected via a bite or bodily fluid , but I'll also accept the means of simply turning after death as depicted in TWD. I do not think that primal, unthinking, unarmed creatures could overrun the human race. Almost every advantage possible goes to us. How on earth is a being, who's potentially only means of reproduction, is also their number one predator, and one of their primary sources of food, supposed to survive? Even if they don't need to feed, and we remove that from equation, it's still just a ridiculous notion. They have to seek out prey that is incomparably more intelligent than them, sometimes, far faster than them, and significantly more armed than them. It wouldn't be so bad, if humans didn't have access to weapons that can put zombies down from 300 meters away, or means of defence that are untouchable, be it in the form armoured vehicles and aircraft. A hallmark of the genre seems to involve characters walking amidst the ruins of military hardware, and it's like the writers just want to flaunt the sheer implausibility of it all. Even with the full surprise factor afforded to a zombie horde, the disarray it could cause shouldn't be any match for the might of modern day communications. It would be like engaging in WW1 over the top trench warfare against an enemy you have zero understanding of, with no comprehension for what kind of firepower lies in wait for you above the parapet, completely unable to communicate with your comrades, and armed only with your hands.

I would compare it to the theory of societal racism that in the USA, where I will draw all my data from white people have a great deal more control over society than black people, and use it to their own benefit and black people's detriment. These theories seem like they would both make a lot of similar predictions about the oppressed group they describe. They would predict that the oppressed group women and black people would be more likely to be low income, homeless, arrested, imprisoned, killed intentionally, killed accidentally on the job, for instance , assaulted, robbed, have things characteristic of their culture and not of others made illegal, have less societal resources dedicated to addressing issues that affect them disproportionately, particularly medical issues, would have less representation in media, be less protected both legally and by social mores, be less likely to get into or graduate from higher education, etc etc. When I look at that list, it seems as though everything on it is true of black people. Thus, the racism theory seems to me to be highly plausible, useful, and make good predictions. If I don't know whether black people are more likely to be assaulted than white people, I can use the racism theory to predict that they will, and I would be correct. However, it seems like only a very few of those things are true of women. The Patriarchy theory seems to not be plausible, useful, or make good predictions. If I don't know whether women are more likely to be assaulted than men, I could use the Patriarchy theory to predict that they would be, and I would be wrong.

Other sports require your body to complete difficult tasks, however the human body is prehistorically adapted to carry out these types of movements. Sports such as football or swimming, though they require the body to be in exceptional shape, incorporate tasks our ancestors utilized in their survival. Yet gymnastics asks one to maneuver their bodies into shapes that the human figure is not meant to form. Subsequently, during the times of ancient Greece, gymnastics was created in order to train other athletes to be successful in their sports. When a gymnast lands vertically back down on the floor after a tumbling pass, there is a force of 8 to 14 times the person\u2019s body weight. We use our body to catapult 13 feet in the air without the assistance of much spring at all. Though other sports include the use of precision and form as well, gymnastics requires one to master these skills. It is possible to complete the skills without it, but in a competition arena, sloppiness scores no points with the judges. Also, unlike so many sports, gymnastics requires a very high level of mental toughness, even over physical ability. On floor if you don\u2019t kick your leg hard enough, or you kick it a little off to the side, or you don\u2019t snap your hands back up quick enough for the takeoff, you could risk a serious crash landing. The same goes for vault, bars and beam. If a golfer for example is feeling a bit off today, maybe she will have some bad scores on her holes. If a gymnast is feeling off, it could cause us to be paralyzed. There\u2019s no powering through it like other high intensity sports.

In the  about Oxford exam times, I found myself embroiled in multiple arguments about what feminism is. I think feminists can acknowledge that there are, on average, differences between men and women. I had a lot of pushback and also several upvotes\u2026but I have no idea if the people commenting \u201cnope, feminists think men and women are exactly the same\u201d were actual feminists correcting me or non feminists feeling salty after interactions with one too many over zealous social media justice warriors. I have no idea if the people upvoting me were feminists saying \u201cnailed it, nice contribution\u201d or non feminists attempting to undermine feminism by making my mis? conception of feminism more visible. I was compared multiple times to that Google engineer who and I admit I did not follow this controversy at all apparently said that women make terrible engineers because of their innate differences. I don\u2019t buy that and I certainly don\u2019t want to be in that camp. So I thought I\u2019d sort it out here, where there\u2019s less room for confusion. Here\u2019s my claim It is not un feminist to acknowledge that, on average, there are biological, psychological, and \u201csociological\u201d that is, arising from different socialization differences between men and women. I\u2019ll list some examples. Biologically, women tend to be shorter, have two X chromosomes, and have thinner cortical regions in the right hemisphere of the brain. Psychologically, women tend to be more extraverted, agreeable, and neurotic. 1 Socially, women tend to be raised in ways that reinforce female gender roles, like being taught how to clean house while men are responsible for outdoor chores. Nothing about acknowledging those trends strikes me as un feminist those seem like uncontroversial scientific facts. But it is anti feminist and unfair to women to take those statistical trends and 1 essentialize them or 2 weaponize them against women. What do I mean by that? Essentializing. It is wrong to say that because women on the whole have a trait, any particular woman ought to have that trait in order to be considered a woman, or be considered a good woman. I don\u2019t want to make this whole thing about trans issues, but one example of this is that women tend to have XX chromosomes, but a trans woman has XY. That doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t a perfectly good woman. For a less polarizing example, women are more likely to be caretakers, but if a woman is particularly ill suited to caretaking in any form, she is no worse a woman than a nurse and devoted mother of five. Essentializing\u2014saying \u201call women are \u201d\u2014forces women in all their variations to abide by the traits of the \u201caverage,\u201d allows people to unfairly and harmfully ostracize women who are different, and holds women back from pursuing their unique interests. Weaponizing. What we absolutely want to avoid is taking generalizations about women and using them to artificially bar women from entering certain fields or behaving in certain ways. For example, women tend to have less upper body strength than men. But disallowing women from becoming firefighters on that basis is utterly unwarranted, because not all women are too weak for the job. Indeed, some women\u2019s size may give them an advantage, because they may seek more effective techniques to perform physical tasks, report injuries, ask for help, and make workplaces safer by reducing \u201chyper masculinity,\u201d hostility, and more effectively weighing risks. 2 So using a generalization and to hold back women as a group or to deny any particular woman access to an opportunity is anti feminist, unfair, and harmful as well. When I was younger I refused to identify as a feminist even though I believed in women\u2019s equality because I thought feminists hated men. Most of my friends and all of my boyfriends were men, and I loved them, understood their issues, and didn\u2019t want to exclude them or shut them down. I\u2019ve only recently come around to letting the feminist flag fly because as it happens not all feminists hate men. But I\u2019m probably going to give up the label again if it turns out that I can\u2019t say things like \u201cstudies show that on average women have higher agreeableness scores on the big 5 personality test\u201d when studies absolutely have shown that.  I can believe that there tend to be differences between men and women and still be a feminist.

One day, granny suffers from a stroke, and the cost to prolong her life acute stent operation, post procedure recovery, nursing home, etc etc is estimated at 250k. The doctor estimates that she could live for another 2 years in a best case scenario. Is the marginal extension of life living until 92 instead of meeting the reaper at 90 really worth the cost? Arguably, the money would be much better spent on younger people who have decades ahead of them. I come from a family of doctors, and the stories I hear at the dinner table are really troubling. You'd be surprised at how much money is poured into saving the very old, just to live for an extra few years sometimes months, and sometimes weeks . Economically, it does not make sense for the average family. Sentimentally, it is hard to justify.

Fat people are the target of discrimination and bullying due to their weight, which is undeniably wrong. But promoting fatness is not the way to support fat people. I understand that defining health is a complex issue and it's not as easy saying that person has some extra lbs, therefore they aren't healthy but the fat acceptance movement's sheltering of obesity normalizes poor health. Obesity is a serious problem and the fat acceptance movement allows us to bypass facing the obesity epidemic as a society. There are major systematic changes that we, as a society, need to address in order to have a healthier populous, and accepting that obesity is okay or promoting it is a barrier to the hard work of changing the way our culture treats food, diet, and exercise. People deserve respect, but part of that respect should include real discussions about weight and finding better ways to support people. Edit To illustrate a few examples of the trends I've seen and point out the difference between the intent of the movement and the byproduct s of it I'm on mobilize so I apologize for formatting There are a number of fativits who write about how being fat is good, I've interpreted that as promoting fatness obesity. Examples I'm FAt. It's OK Photo Series Proves Fat is Beautiful Glorifying Obesity You can find Fat is Fabulous posts all over Tumblr and other social media sites. I think the difference here is the original intent of the movement. I see that the intent of the movement is to end discrimination against fat people, but I think many individuals use that as a scapegoat to normalize obesity. Cathy Young wrote a succinct article that reflects my thoughts that may be a better descriptor Pro Fat An Unhealthy Status Quo EDIT 2 POST  A number of people have illustrated the difference between the fat acceptance movement and the fat people acceptance movement, which is the key differentiator for me. Yes, there are radicals as in any movement who take the message further to say that obesity the illness is healthy, which is not true. But as I understand, the moderates of the fat acceptance movement simply aim to normalize the existence of obese people in an effort to make their lives less hellacious. There are a lot of people who are hung up on the normalizing aspect of this thread and who have pointed out that of course the movement aims to normalize obesity. I posted this thread with a common understanding that obesity, the illness, is bad, and should not be upheld, glorified, promoted, etc That said, I understand there are differentiating interpretations on the word normalizing . I see the point that normalizing doesn't always equate to condoning, as in, we should normalize mental health issues, but that does not mean we glorify mental health problems. Thus, I think my real issue here has been associating the movement and it's intent with radicals. I would, therefore, appreciate links to resources that are upstanding representations of moderate thinkers of the fat acceptance movement.

Too expensive, too crowded, and if I want to drink during the film I have to smuggle in a flask. Bleh. Not my cup of tea. As a consequence I didn't get around to watching Black Panther until recently when it was added to Netflix. So I'm a little late to the discussion, but hopefully that's a good thing here since maybe y'all have had a chance to breathe after the flurry of a dozen or so s about the film came out several months ago. I also haven't seen my specific topic discussed here. Given the hype I thought I'd be blown away. I wasn't. It was a decently made and fairly average superhero movie. I liked some parts and didn't like others. After watching the movie I did a bit of digging into its reception, and have concluded that the movie was first and foremost a movie about politics or perhaps more a political statement, and that's also the reason for its almost overwhelmingly positive reception. Now, there's nothing wrong with a movie being more of a political statement than a form of entertainment. Plenty of works of art, movies included, make such statements sometimes they're subtle, other times, glaring and overriding. That's all fine. But being a good movie compelling plot, interesting characters, immersive world, thoughtful cinematography, appropriate soundtrack, etc. and making a solid political statement aren't always the same thing, and I'm in part making the case that it's often getting positive reviews as a good movie even though the real reason people like it is because of the political statement. I think this in no small part because those good movie points I just listed were middling and mediocre at best in Black Panther. The CGI was superb, as one might expect from a movie with BP's price tag, but that was the only objectively above average thing about it. I believe, and I think that we all know at some level, that Black Panther wouldn't be arguably the most critically acclaimed and certainly highest grossing superhero movie of all time if it wasn't due to the political climate today. I've identified five different types of reviews Those that thought the movie was absolute trash. These are generally not written by professional critics nor published by serious publications although I have found ones critiquing specific aspects of the movie, like shaming people for supporting hashtag TeamKillmonger . Most of these reviews were by amateurs, and were the sort removed by Rotten Tomato under the auspice of them being hate speech. Most seem give a glowing review of the movie from a technical good movie standpoint and don't touch on the politics as much or at all. This would be like the Rotten Tamato's Critic Consensus that Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU's most absorbing stories and introducing some of its most fully realized characters. Many others seem to focus more on the black experience in America than the film itself, such as this NYT piece that spends three paragraphs droning on about Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter and the theater being an African American cultural hub before it even mentions anything about the movie. Arguably that was the point of the article, but it's still a common theme in a lot of reviews even by professional movie critics. These reviews tend to be chalk full of how empowering it is for black people to finally have a movie they can relate to and how Wakanda is an example of how great African nations would be if it weren't for the evils of colonialism. A handful go even more extreme, and critique the movie for not being progressive or revolutionary enough. This Esquire piece being one example. In these types of reviews I've seen critiques of the decision to include even one token white person on the good guy's side nobody seems to have an issue with greedy, deranged, evil, and violent Klaue being white, though , criticism that T'Challa didn't do anything to smash the Wakandan patriarchy, ire aimed at the directors for not including any LGBT stuff, and of course glowing support for Killmonger since, despite being an American 1 er who has killed what looks like hundreds and hundreds of people in cold blood just so he could get the chance to kill the son of a guy who killed his dad for being a traitor who stole from the state and tried to kill the king and, once in power, shat all over ancient traditions, consolidated as much power for himself as possible, and beat on and threatened women but you can't root against Killmonger because he's a black guy from America Oakland, no less, and what black guy from Oakland wouldn't want to use advanced weaponry to kill off millions of white people sorry, colonizers in an effort to enact a new black ethnostate world order? And all this despite the fact Killmonger's motives for hating wh colonizers isn't actually touched on in the film at all, it's just assumed by the audience. Needless to say these reviewers still often think Black Panther is the best thing since sliced bread, they just think it could've been even better. Last but not least, my personal favorite kind of fair review one that acknowledges and credits the political climate that contributes to the hype around the film, then neatly sets all that aside and reviews the film on its own merits, in this case finding it rather wanting. It's not racist or venting hatred of identity politics. It's not interjecting it's own radical progressive politics into the review. It's not pretending like the political and social hype makes it a good movie while also not ignoring those factors, summing up far more eloquently than I just did Ultimately, it's more interesting to think about than it is to watch. To sum up, my view is essentially just that the reasons for Black Panther's accolades, it's box office success, and the hype surrounding it had little to nothing to do with the quality of the movie itself and everything to with what the first black movie meant in a political and social climate like the one we're in right now. If you could box up the whole MCU collection and ship it off to an alternate reality where people didn't really care about race and had no conception of racial history and contemporary racial tensions aside from what they learned in the movie , Black Panther wouldn't stand out in the slightest. I don't exactly want this view changed in the traditional sense of wanting things I mean, it's my opinion about a movie. I'm not exactly hellbent on having my opinion on any movie changed. But, like I said massive accolades, massive , massive hype and a massive number of people I know personally saying it's a phenomenal movie. I disagree, but I'm open to being wrong.

This is strictly NOT a soapbox disguised as a . This is a sincere pedagogy about net neutrality tailored for my specific purposes. It's really about changing my view, should it be justified. While I'm a heavy internet user, I often consider what it would be like if I just stopped somehow. I imagine it would be good. I would have more time to practice my instruments. I could read more, watch more movies, and generally do all the traditional things I'm doing. If somehow destroying net neutrality likewise destroyed the internet, I would transition well into a regressed era. And if the internet was so badly broken that it got in the way of not even being a consistent user, there would be enough backlash that it would adjust at least enough to be useable. While I enjoy a range of benefits, the foundation of my internet use is based on crowdsourcing opinions and answers. Something I'll do is ask a question inquiring about the personal lives and souls of CasualConversationalists as a self hermeneutic device to compare work about our own souls. This is great. I enjoy doing this. But it would be neutral or positive on net given the benefit of having my free time back. I want to specify some things about how I use my personal time and how it may or may not affect me if the internet were ruined. For example, I mentioned I watch movies. It's not common, but I do. I do have streaming services that come with cable, but I mainly watch movies I own on itunes. I do stream them. If something happened that ruined itunes streaming, it would affect me somewhat. It's not clear it would be a disaster. For one thing, you can download movies and watch them other ways than steaming. But perhaps this would somehow be impossible and I simply couldn't watch movies. That's fine. I'm not a big movie person. I have enough DVDs anyway. The basics of what I just said apply for tv and similar programming, added that I don't enjoy tv. Music is more important to me. I use Apple Music daily. It would be fine if I couldn't stream, but if I somehow couldn't listen to my music at all, that would be bad. That approaches societal catastrophe levels, and I think the backlash concept applies. I mentioned that I play instruments. A frequent thing people do is look up videos on Youtube or use other resources to learn. I do this a little, but I primarily utilize teachers, which is the root advice instrumentalists would give you anyway. I enjoy reading. But I read physical. I own many books. I could do well in an apocalypse scenario if my house were a bunker, because I have hundreds of books. I don't use social media in any substatial way and am a very private person. As long as I can text my best friend and parents, that's fine. So basically the scenario is if I can listen to music, play music, read, and text my loved ones, I will be a happy person.

The amount of power it gives to criminals is frightening. Especially in countries such as Mexico. In many ways it is ruining those countries, or large parts of them. In more developed countries it has a massive impact on poorer areas. The opportunity for criminals to make money from drugs should be taken away. What gives the state the right to use force to prevent people from buying drugs? Do people not have the right to buy something that they want to use for themselves when it doesn't have any harmful effects on other people? Look at all the anti social behaviour that results from the consumption of alcohol. Why is it that some drugs that don't result in anti social behaviour are made illegal when alcohol is legal? The right to manufacture and sell drugs should be given exclusively to the state. This could prevent any unwanted promotion or profit driven element from the sale of drugs. The income from this and savings from policing the war on drugs could be invested in education and disadvantaged areas to prevent people from getting getting into bad drug habits.

I can't find the exact comments right now, but as someone who's skimmed through, I've seen a lot of misogynistic comments downvoted. On a final note, MensRights tends to focus on actual rights, where as TheRedPill tends to focus on Male Female relationships. Okay, now on to my view of TheRedPill. I am not really a redpiller, but I am not someone who thinks they are a hate group either. What TheRedPill is, is unfiltered male talk. Even TheRedPill recognizes that there is an anger phase. And TheRedPill users allow men to get that out of their system. That's why you see the occasional misogynistic and mean posts, is because of the anger phase. There's 5 stages of Red Pill and even they say that the final stage is acceptance where Women aren't bad. My expectations of them, and theirs of me, were based on faulty premises. They are creatures of instinct, just like I am but of different instincts. If I learn what those instincts are, and teach them about mine, we can develop realistic expectations of each other and get along just fine. Does that sound like misogyny? I think not. Basically, the final stage of TheRedPill is anti misogyny, and about understanding women. The Red Pill is a perfect place for socially awkward guys who never understood how dating works. Some guys have never had the talk with their parents. No one has ever taught them how to flirt, or anything. Many of these guys can develop Nice Guy Syndrome and follow girls like a wounded puppy, never getting a woman to be attracted to them. Thus, TheRedPill helps nip that in the bud, and actually be an alpha and attract women. All and all, while TRP and MRM are two different things, both of them have way more hate than they deserve. The only reason why they are hated, is because the world is becoming more progressive pro feminist, and anything that goes against that status quo is misogynistic, predigest, racist, etc etc. We live in a world where it is no longer PC to talk about white issues, men's issues, wealthy people's issues, etc."}, {"conclusion": "I think the \"Stand Your Ground\" laws in many US states are some of the best laws to come about in the last 20 years,", "id": 57981, "argument": "I know the Zimmerman case is all that anyone wants to talk about with this recently, but I think that, when used properly, Stand Your Ground laws allow a person to show that they won't back down in the face of evil and give them protection from malicious prosecution in instances of self defense.

Often this behavior has no direct negative effects on anyone other than the one partaking in it. There are plenty of obvious examples, especially regarding drug use and driving behavior no crack, meth, heroin, etc. no driving without a seat belt no motorcycle riding without a helmet. There are also less direct examples, like laws making it difficult for people to get assistance with suicide. I think that the spirit of these laws is fundamentally justified. Obviously each law has to be treated on its own merits, but the abstract idea of legally protecting people from themselves makes sense. Here is the logic behind it, using a free adult as an example written in the second person . Society raised you from birth until the time you began working society includes your parents. During that time you contributed essentially nothing to society while consuming a lot of resources. After you began working, you continued to benefit from the services which society provides. Self destructive behavior truncates your productive lifespan, hence your contribution to society. Because society invests into each individual without knowing how much they will produce, it is the moral imperitive of each individual to contribute as much to society as they are able to. In other words, society is gambling on each individual, and therefore the winnings from both the double 7s and the snake eyes rightfully belong to it. This doesn't mean confiscating your property, since you are yourself a part of society. It simply means ensuring that your production is not abolished through self destructive behaviors. It is the right of society to have laws protecting their investments you . There is an obvious problem with this point of view nobody asked you whether you should be born. It's not as if you entered into a legal contract with society in eutero. Unfortunately, this is impossible to do. However, you still have the right to be removed from the social contract at any time. It will simply result in you going to jail for violating the laws of society such as those against self destructive behavior . In that way the problem of consent solves itself. The alternative to limiting self destructive behavior is the idea that any individual should be allowed to do anything they want whenever they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. It's an appealing idea, but I think it's overly simplistic and ignores the group nature of humans. Plenty of people support the idea, though, and I'd love to hear their take on this. gt This is a footnote from the  moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

The U.S. Government would benefit from a third party political leader due to the fact that our curried major political parties Republican and Democratic are restricted by the public and private opinion within their political parties, and make decisions based off of those restrictions, which ultimately results in an oligarchical method of governing the country. These two parties have a significantly long history of being competitive and distrustful, if not downright disrespectful and hostile, which impairs their ability to reason and accept policies, bills, or any decision regarding foreign affairs just because they simply do not hold each other in a high regard. Politics has become a game of who you know and those who are proficient at manipulation and debate rise up to the top, regardless of their individual ability to make the best decisions for the country. For these reasons, I believe that the U.S. Government would benefit greatly from a third party political leader. Not only would it remove the restrictions in place by the Democrat vs. Republican mentality, it would also allow that president to act according to his her own beliefs and judgement, without the fear of being socially cast aside by their group, or being instantly vetoed on every matter because of the party they're affiliated with.

Before I begin though, I will say that there definitely are times when the sub is better than the dub. If I can't stand the voice acting of the dub, then I'd much rather watch the sub. Or other times, the lines are so melodramatic that it grates in your native tongue but reading it in a sub is a much different experience that won't get that same negative reaction from you. Or hell, maybe you just don't feel like waiting for the dub to come out if the sub is already here. But if we assume that the dub is well done, then my following points make a lot of sense. Anime is a visual media. The more you're looking at the visuals and less reading text on the bottom of the screen, the better. The main advantage a screen has over a book is that you can see and hear the motion and the audio if you're READING as this is happening you're missing out on some of that. Localization can be weird. Some phrases directly translated from Japanese are just awkward in English. Plenty of times I read something on a sub and I think I've literally never heard anyone say that phrase in my entire life. However when an anime is dubbed it's usually localized into an equivalent, familiar phrase in English. E.g. nobody says unsightly over here in normal conversation. Like ever. But holy hell it's like a catch all word in a sub. Never shows up in a dub though. Humor gets lost. Comedy depends a lot on timing. However, the speed at which a character speaks and the speed at which the subbed text appears on the screen are often not lined up at all, so you end up reading the 'punch line' moment before it's even happened to the characters. This diminishes funny moments. Emotion and inflection are more easily detected in your own language. Sure, I keep hearing that if you watch enough subbed anime, you get better at this. But it's still true for anyone who doesn't exclusively watch subs for a very long amount of time. It is easier to empathize with characters if you can truly hear the happiness or sadness or pain or anger in their voice. You might be able to build up your ear for Japanese but there's just not much incentive to, given all of these points. So in conclusion, if the dub is good, just watch the dub. Unless you don't want to wait or you think the dub is just wack. Examples of anime I watch dubbed because I find the dub to be amazing Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia Examples of anime where I hate the dub so I watch it subbed Attack on Titan Example of an anime where I don't wait for the dub, and don't especially like the dub One Punch Man So it's not that I never watch subs but I don't think people should be elitist and scoff at dubs simply because they're dubs. A dub is not bad just because it is a dub. Some dubs ARE garbage though, so I don't fault anyone who avoids those if you can't stand the voice of the main character, how could you ever enjoy watching it? but dubs should be given a chance. There are plenty where I can find absolutely no fault in their voice acting so why not watch it instead of try to watch and read it at the same time?"}, {"conclusion": "The United Nations is the best forum to tackle climate change.", "id": 106692, "argument": "Countries are more likely to comply with climate policies when they are under international pressure."}, {"conclusion": "GPA Shouldn't Be Used By Colleges To Determine Admission", "id": 120284, "argument": "The biggest issue with GPA is that course content grading in high school lacks standards. A class taught by one teacher or high school may be easy to get an A in, whereas the same class taught by another school or teacher may be extremely difficult. In r news there is a controversy over a particular highschool that provided ways to boost student grades in order to boost graduation rates. This is a prime example of the insignificance of GPA. Some high schools may be strict on students and have strict grading students must meet homework deadlines, no exceptions, no test retakes, etc. At the same time, another school may provide so many second chances and grade recovery programs that make achieving a decent grade requires little effort. Additionally, the importance of GPA discourages challenging students to learn the most they can. As it stands, it's far easier to take an easy class and get a guaranteed 'A' than to take a challenging AP class, and simply maintain a 'C'. When I was in high school I intentionally took the easiest available classes, so that I could get an A with minimal effort. I would literally sleep through most of class, do homework on the bus, yet I'd still get an A because the content was extremely dumbed down. And this strategy worked. I maintained a solid GPA, but I could have learned so much more. I regret it so much if I had just taken the harder classes, I would have learned a ton, even if I didn't get a higher grade. But with the need to get a 3.0 or better ideally 3.5 4.0 to make it into prestigious universities, I felt too pressured to take the easy route, where I learned pretty much nothing. It's just so depressing, I wonder how much more I could know and understand if I used my highschool time to the fullest. As a result, GPA doesn't tell a university much about what a student knows, their ability to learn, or their work ethic, as class difficulty is inconsistent, and many don't need to try due to taking easy classes. Tests such as the ACT or SAT tell far more by challenging its participants to think hard for a solution, and quickly absorb information."}, {"conclusion": "It is also imperative to look at the alternatives when assessing in what form of energy to invest. ...", "id": 107703, "argument": "It is also imperative to look at the alternatives when assessing in what form of energy to invest. For the reasons explained above diminishing supply, environmental damage we can rule fossil fuels out immediately. We also see enormous problems with every form of alternative energy. The most efficient source of renewable energy has been hydroelectric power. However, this usually creates more problems than it solves. Building a large dam necessarily floods an enormous region behind the dam which in turn can displace tens of thousands of people. There are also enormous ecological costs to dam building. A classical example is the Aswan dam in Egypt along the Nile. Not only did many thousands lose their homes but the yearly inundation of the Nile, which fertilised the surrounding land for thousands of year, was also stopped. The subsequent silting up of the river destroyed much wildlife. A similar story of ecological destruction and human homelessness surrounded the more recent Three Gorges dam project in China. Solar energy has never lived up to expectations since it is hugely inefficient. A solar panel the size of Europe would be needed to power a city the size of London! Wind energy is only marginally better with an unsightly wind farm the size of Texas needed to provide the energy for Texas alone. The worst performers of all have been geothermal and tidal energy which have been hopelessly inefficient because no rocks have been found that are hot enough and no waves have been found that are strong enough! The great irony is that not only are most renewable sources inefficient but many are also ecologically unsound! The opposition to the building wind farms in certain areas has been just as strong as the opposition to nuclear power because wind farms destroy the scenery, being so unsightly and large, and may also be bad for wildlife."}, {"conclusion": "The Federation has a much more stable and prosperous economy.", "id": 95282, "argument": "The Federation has a larger fleet than the Rebels and significantly greater shipbuilding capacity.

With many police departments recently in the last 5 years under investigation by the Federal DoJ, it's readily apparent that this is not a one off problem, it's a systemic issue. For example, the Seattle PD was recently cited by the DoJ as not being able to differentiate between an interaction in which they are asking a citizen for information, and arresting them that is to say, they don't seem to understand that citizens are free to go as they please if they are not being charged. This suggests that at least at the Seattle PD , officers presume guilt why else would they arrest someone for simply not wanting to talk? . I think this is due to the nature of their jobs. I believe that if we were to rotate police officers in and out of other civil service duties, we would have a much better execution of power force.

George Wallace was in fact a bigot, and a racist, and really an asshole. To me, however, that does not justify murder. I tried to tell the people accusing me of being delusional by simply trying to make the point that everybody has a different point of view on life, and everybody has their own opinions. I don't just use this point for people like George Wallace. Hitler, for instance, just had a different point of view, and lived in a different time.

It's completely normal for us today to eat meat, but who knows, maybe society in the future has grown so progressive that it is a crime to walk around not looking at the ground, lest you accidentally step on a bug. When you think about it, the morals we live by today are completely pointless. Take nature, for example. Animals kill each other mindlessly for food, yet we don't send them to jail for doing so.

A possible counter argument is that it opens up the system to abuse. I dont think this is true because the potential labor force is already pretty massive in the US, so there's probably little reason to need more people than we already have.

I don't particular like the poetry, still, but I see how it fits in with deeper understanding of the Bilbo, the writer.

Either that or they just bought their vehicle outright because they're well off. Warranties are offered to begin with so the salesmen and car dealerships can offer a sense of security for the customer while making money. In other words, if warranties didn't make car dealerships money they wouldn't exist. If the car dealership is increasing their profits, they're also decreasing the money in your bank account. For most people in North America at least there are countless repair shops capable of handling almost all issues involving modern vehicles. Finding a repair place outside of a dealership isn't unusual or difficult. In the case of purchasing a warranty dealership repairs will be less expensive or completely covered. However even when paying for a warranty it will inevitably expire and continuing to go to a dealership for repairs will have lost it's appeal entirely. Essentially when your car is youngest and needs the least amount of repairs, your car is covered. 2015 2016 future vehicles are far more reliable then vehicles of the late 1900s. Repairs are more seldom, even if they do cost more per repair. This is easy to maintain regardless of a warranty. Possible exceptions to the above ? Warranties offer peace of mind. Dealerships can always be counted on to cover the repairs they state they will cover. They will ultimately solve the mechanical issue you are experiencing. Personally I don't require this peace of mind, how many people do? Warranties allow more car dealerships to stay in business, allowing more competition. This inevitably assists in keeping prices from spiking too high. Car offers are everywhere. OEM parts aren't necessarily used if you don't get repairs done at a dealership is this true? The reasoning to get a warranty just doesn't add up for me, unless you are buying literally the worst mass production vehicle ever.

As I see it, the problem with this is that the complexities of a progressive system make it insanely easy to avoid taxes if you are rich or connected. If you are a company, you can use IP transfer pricing to get your profits out of the country and keep it there with another loophole. If you're an individual, there are countless other ways to reduce your tax burden. In many ways, it's tough to blame them. CEOs have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders, and no one really wants to pay tax as an individual. Worse, the rash of tax inversions we saw last year demonstrates just how much our high corporate tax rate which incidentally is only high because other countries have lowered theirs in a race to the bottom is pushing companies offshore. The best alternative i see is a high VAT consumption tax across the board and an elimination of almost all other taxes we should probably hold on to the estate tax to keep inequality from running away on us. This tax is inherently regressive, but it's also virtually impossible to evade. From what I understand, it's also less distortionary than the income or corporate tax. The money that we raise from this could then be distributed via progressive programs to make up for the regressive nature of the VAT. I'm partial to a progressive minimum income, universal health care and free education, but that's just me. I think that this is where liberals in the US should be focusing our efforts instead of the push for higher taxes on the rich. It seems more realistic and effective.

WARNING This is a long read, but if you are able to read it all, I applaud you for it, and believe it will help for you to change my view. Now, you may be wondering, Why are you asking me to change my mind? Well I have friends who are furries, and they want me to stop looking at them with judgement. And frankly, I do too. It's getting in the way of our friendships and I want to be rid of it. But I can't help but hate furries if I hold these reasons to be true. So please, if you can, prove me wrong. Furries are the worst. They are extremely toxic and sexual and the fandom is just a cesspool of degeneracy. They wonder why they are hated so much and blame it all on the 13 year old edgelords and the loud minority , but in reality they only have themselves to blame for all the hate, and fail to take responsibility for the degenerate actions they do. Sexuality This is a big one. Furries will gladly tell you that being a furry isn't a sexual thing, but in reality it is a fetish that fucks with your sexuality, masquerading as a family friendly hobby. The furry fandom revolves around sex in a way that other mainstream fandoms do not. Furries will always try to tell you that it's not all about sex, and that those perverts don't represent us, in an attempt to make their fandom look presentable to the general public. They try to make it look like a simple interest suitable for all ages. They'll say things along the line of it's just a liking to anthropomorphic animals . In reality, it is anything but family friendly. It is an inherent fetish community that is about sexualizing anthropomorphic animals. Not many other fandoms, outside of inherent kink communities, have the same mentality. Anime isn't inherently about hentai. Steven Universe isn't inherently about Greg fucked a rock . And the sex aspect about the furry fandom is way more central to the community than, let's say, hentai is to the anime community. The furry fandom is inherently sexual, despite what everyone will tell you. There is porn of everything that has to do with anthropomorphic animals. Literally e v e r y t h i n g. And most of the people that make this kind of porn are furries. Examples range from characters of Disney movies Zootopia, The Lion King, etc. , to mascots Zabivaka, Pinkfong , and there's tons of porn of people's characters and tons of artists who draw it. People will pay lots of money for a popular good artist to draw their character. There isn't much there that isn't porn. The sales halls of furry conventions are full of it, the artwork sites are full of it, furries' hard drives are full of it, you get it. The furry fandom is pretty much centered around porn. It's pretty much impossible to isolate yourself from the porn. Other mainstream fandoms don't revolve around porn in the same way. Other fandoms don't go around celebrating sex and porn and then say that it's not about sex. Sure, Rule 34 is absolutely a thing, but it isn't as central to other communities as it is to the furry community. You can't be a furry without someone assuming that you're in it for the porn. You can, however, be a fan of anime and or video games without people thinking you like hentai illustrated porn. Not only is it porn, but it's actual sex. Furries have lots of sex. Looots of it. Having lots of sex isn't a bad thing in itself, but what is bad is how furries take it and distort it. Conventions end up functioning as vectors for sex. There, older people often take advantage of younger people who are lonely, horny, and or don't have a lot of experience with love or sex. This can lead to things like rape and transmission of STDs. Sometimes the sex in conventions is totally illegal if one or both parties is not the age of consent where the convention is being held. Not only is it sex at a convention, but it's also other things, like non consensual touching masked as pounces , glomping , etc., pairs of people who aren't similar ages, collars on people's necks, large dogs, and people with tattoos of the Greek letter zeta, \u03b6 meaning zoophile . Conventions of other fandoms like Star Trek, Comic Con, etc. for the most part are exempt from these things. They don't sell as much porn as a furry con. There isn't even as much porn in the sales halls as there is at a furry con. Not as much sex stuff happens at other cons to the same degree as a furry con. At all. Other conventions don't really have the same type of people drawn to the furry fandom. Lonely, isolated, socially inept, horny, and who use the furry fandom as an escapist fantasy. The furry fandom hosts many sexual fetishes and kinks. Some of them are legal, others, not so much. Everyone in the fandom has at least one sexual fetish or kink. Some furries are pretty vanilla. Others Well, they have lists of kinks as long as your grocery list. This wouldn't be a problem if the furry community didn't revolve around kinks as much as it does. It's pretty much what everyone in the fandom talks about with each other. This is not a healthy way to have a conversation. People in other fandoms outside of kink communities , or not in any fandom at all, don't just casually talk about their kinks and sexual interests like it's your average small talk. Everyone in the fandom will want to do sexual roleplay with you. They will actively try to do anything to get you to do it with them, from guilting to even threatening and or blackmailing you into it. This is because the fandom is filled with horny people where sex is always on their minds. You don't get anime or Star Wars fans actively trying to force you to roleplay with them. At all. This is exclusively a furry thing, and it needs to stop. This is what drove Tony the Tiger off of Twitter. Everyone expressing their thirst for him and tweeting stuff like UwU frost my flakes daddy Tony x3~ . Mass blocking occurred, and Kellogg's couldn't take it anymore, so Tony went offline. I swear furries have no one but themselves to blame for all the hate. You don't see the Star Wars fans publicly expressing their thirst for Rey. You don't see anime fans casually flaunting around their love for Mai or Yoshino. Only furries do this, only furries it is. Then there are the illegal kinks, and the furry fandom has a problem with them. Examples include pedophilia, necrophilia, zoophilia, and maybe even actual bestiality. Every other week, a furry is exposed for being a pedophile and or doing something with underage kids. Every other week, a furry is exposed for liking their pets a little too much. Every other week, one of these zoophiles gets outed for actually having sex with an animal. Pedophiles are everywhere in the furry community. Just look up furry pedophile on Google and you'll find a ton of news stories of Furry men busted for having sex with minor . Not only is it that, but a lot of people draw cub porn, which is the furry equivalent of child porn. There's even a debate I'm the community on whether it's okay or not. There shouldn't be a debate, it's art that depicts children and it's fucked. Many furries have been exposed as pedophiles, with more to come. Have you heard of Kero the Wolf? I'm pretty sure you have. Yeeeah, having sex with your dog until it dies, and then having sex with other dead animals and sharing it with your other friends who also like to fuck dead animals, really isn't the best thing to do. Really makes your fandom look bad. And I think you've heard of the Discord cub porn scandal already. There are actually furries who get turned on by actual animals. There are actually furries who want to have sex with animals. There are actually furries who group together and celebrate and or practice this degenerate behaviour. There are actually Discord and Telegram groups dedicated to that shit. Let that sink in. All other communities deal with their problems effectively, furries don't. All they do is make a ton of drama and call outs whenever this stuff gets exposed, they don't actively try to do something to fix these problems and get these people help or out of the fandom. And even after all that happens, there will still be a sizable chunk of people that still support the person that got exposed. After a few months, things will be back to normal like it never even happened. All in all, furries will gladly sweep stuff like this under the rug and say it's not this way. They will try to tell you that it isn't about sex with animals , just to make their fandom look good. They don't realize that it would be better for both the fandom and the reputation of it to actually deal with their problems. Murrsuiters, zoophiles, and pedophiles are definitely at conventions too. The fandom definitely has a problem with these things. They are problematic in a way that hentai is not to the anime fan. Being a furry also fucks with your sexuality. It will mostly be a secret. Explaining it be a lot of work and not worth even bringing up. And when you outgrow it, it'll hang around and make you feel bad and shameful that you were ever a part of it. They may also never be rid of their acquired fetishes in the future. People will always make assumptions about a furry's sexuality in ways that being associated with other fandoms do not. Stating that one likes anime does not mean that people think they have a thing for hentai or catgirls. However, it is common for furries to be associated with people who like their pets a little too much. The world will always assume the worst, and there's nothing that can be done about it. No other mainstream fandom has these kinds of problems. No other fandom creates and sells as much porn as the furry fandom does. No other fandom has a massive sexual part that its members try to downplay and say that it isn't about that. No other fandom has conventions where wild sex shit happens and where STDs are spread. No other fandom is full of pedophiles that get busted by the police. No other fandom has as large of a subset of people, who actually want to fuck dogs to death with the wide end of a baseball bat, than the furry fandom does. No other fandom sweeps their problems under the rug in an attempt to make everything seem okay. And no other fandom is assumed to be as sexual and problematic as the furry fandom is. No. Other. Mainstream. Fandom. Has. These. Problems. Toxicity The furry fandom is one of the most toxic fandoms out there. It is worse than even the likes of Sonic, Undertale, and K Pop, which are all considered to be pretty toxic fandoms. The fandom is full of people that are not like your average person in normal society. They tend to be white, male, and around 20 ish years old. And a lot of them can be any one or more of the following Special snowflakes, neckbearded, troubled teens, depressed, socially awkward, hateful, and or an SJW. Very different demographics from the rest of society. The SJWs are the worst. The fandom is full of them. They will attack anyone for any reason, as minor as it can be. Even the smallest fuck up can make someone a target of these SJWs. They will jump on and attack people in droves, sometimes even driving said target to commit suicide just to get away from it all. They will try to actively push out anyone they don't even remotely like. And they know all. You've done something they don't agree with? Even if it was many many years ago? Congrats Now you're the ass and target of the entire fandom, and everyone is going to shit on you for that heinous thing you've done. This is how drama starts. Whenever drama happens, everyone jumps on the bandwagon and starts blowing everything out of proportion and dogpiling on what's happening. It becomes the talk of the town. Everyone discusses it, everyone attacks the main subject for it, and everyone wants justice to be served. Data about the person will be leaked, rumors and gossip will be spread around, and someone out there will always take it too far. Sometimes, someone will even impersonate the person in question to try to make them look bad, just to rub salt in the wound. This kind of behaviour has led to people straight up leaving the fandom, or even committing suicide, because it is just too much. People in the fandom are like piranhas on this stuff, they will not let go. They do not forgive and they do not forget. Eventually the drama does die down, but not without leaving its mark on the fandom. Sometimes the drama is even rekindled a while after it is thought to be over. And if you so happen to be the subject on any form of social media after the drama has started, people will assume you are somehow still supporting this person, and will block you and cut off all contact with you, never to give you a second chance. Essentially, following someone automatically equals supporting them, even if you haven't interacted or paid money to them. This is a really stupid way to end prevent relationships. Other forms of toxicity include Fursuit elitism If you own a fursuit, you are automatically popular in the fandom and absolved of all sin. Everyone likes you. You can do no wrong. Everything you do is totally justified. And those without fursuits are lower than you and subject to the same basic social, moral, and behavioural guidelines that everyone else is but you are somehow not. You see how problematic this is? Popufurs and their fanpeople Again, if you are a popular furry, you can do no wrong. The fanpeople are even worse. They will blindly follow that popular furry and attack and shit on anyone who opposes them. They'll continue to support that furry even if they get exposed for doing something bad. Egocentrism Many furries often think about no one but themselves, nothing but their own pleasure. They don't think about how their actions have consequences and how they impact other people. They can be very self centered. This is not the way to live life. It should be common practice to improve others' well being at the expense of some of yours, if they need it. The furry fandom is one of the more toxic fandoms out there, to say the least. Its forms of toxicity are very unique, not found in many other fandoms. It just goes to show that furries can only look towards themselves if they're wondering why they're hated so much. Lack of awareness There is an utter lack of self awareness and common sense in the furry fandom. A form of behaviour not seen in many other fandoms. Furries always make fools of themselves, do things that people in other fandoms don't, and make themselves the laughingstock of the internet. One of these things is RainFurrest. A convention that was held in Seattle until 2015, that was the year everything went to shit. Literally. There was lots of damage to the hotel after RainFurrest was hosted for the year, more than every other event held there combined. This went on for the last 5 years of RainFurrest's existence. There was flooding in the bathrooms because someone loosened a bolt on the toilets. The hot tub was closed for most of the con because of vandalism. People got busted for doing drugs. There were babyfurs a furry who likes to essentially be a baby as a persona and diapers everywhere, and yes, some of them were full. The convention got kicked out of the hotel and couldn't rehome. It shut down. I can think of literally no other fandom that does this kind of stuff. No other fandom has damaged a hotel enough to where it got banned from not only that hotel, but every other one in the state. All the other Star Trek and Anime conventions are completely exempt from this shit. Not only was it RainFurrest, but there are also other cons. A convention in Oklahoma, Oklacon, was shut down because a few people had decided to register for the con and then do illegal sexual activity at the venue it was an outdoor con , and put it under Oklacon's name. As a result, they got banned from their venue too and shut down. More recently, some furries that attended Anthrocon 2017 actually projected furry porn onto a city building for all to see. Yet more recently, videos circulated on Twitter early last year, involving two people in pup hoods suggestively wrestling on the lobby floor at FWA 2018, out in the open for everyone to see. And at BLFC 2018, some guy pissed on the floor around the elevators. You know, I would have just put up fire hydrants all around the con for them to piss at. At these conventions, there are room parties, where people gather and lots of alcohol is consumed and lots of sex is had. This isn't very ideal for the convention, as drunk people can haphazardly damage the hotel and or hurt other people in their drunken stupor. Not only that, but STDs like HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia get passed around at these conventions, further proving that furry conventions also serve as gathering places for horny people to have sex. One more thing, people at these conventions seem to be unable to practice basic hygiene, insisting on being a musky husky . Gross. Again, there are other hobbies and interests that hold big ass conventions that don't have these things. And I've already told you about the whole Tony the Tiger thing. On Twitter, and all around the rest of the internet, in fact, you will see furries making fools of themselves. Fursuits with breasts and big bellies because the suiter has a vore fetish, furries making disgusting art of degenerate kinks like scat diapers , making cancerous memes, sexualizing everything, being socially awkward, etc. Too much to list. You'll see this kind of behaviour not only online, but in real life too. All in all, the furry fandom is home to some very awkward stuff that makes you wonder if anyone in it has any self awareness at all. Overall, there are plenty of reasons to hate furries, ranging from how sexual they are, to the degenerate actions they do. They only have themselves to look towards for answers on why they are hated so much. They do things that not many other fandoms would even think to do in a million years. The fandom is full of degeneracy and toxicity, and void of self awareness. If you think this is the work of a loud minority , then how come the silent majority isn't doing anything about it? And why do these cases of a loud minority happen more frequently and in higher counts than any other fandom? It seems like this loud minority is not a minority at all. If it were, it'd be a pretty big one. And again, blaming it on a loud minority is just an excuse to dismiss the problems at hand. You can't dismiss them forever. Fix them. If you think all other fandoms are like this, no. I've repeatedly said that there are degenerate things done in the furry fandom that are not done anywhere else. The bad side of the furry fandom is bigger than any other fandom, should the other fandoms also have a bad side . Now, as I have said before, I have friends who are furries, and they want me to stop looking at them with judgement. But I can't help but do that if I hold these reasons to be true.

I appreciate you all. x200B Before I continue I just want to clarify I love Japanese culture and in no way think the overall Japanese population is at all at fault, the same way I believe any population should never suffer for the sins of their fathers. I am Australian, so I am not pro US Japan China. That being said I want to focus on most predominantly for the raping of Nanking. They consistently deny it happening, blame Korea, blame Chinese looters, blame Chinese ladies of the night. Rapes of thousands of females every night, including children. Babies being skewered onto the ends of their bayonets. Over 200,000 murders Competitions to see who could behead the most Chinese and those competitors being treated like hero\u2019s in Japanese published news papers I\u2019ll leave a link here because a lot of the things the Japanese did were sickening and not everyone wants to read about it all. We label the Nazi regime and cohorts as the big bad for WW2 in our world politics video games movies and fiction but japan has largely escaped negative representation and even worse, persecution for what they did and the current government is built upon that denial and lack of ramifications. Japanese nationals, the lack of punishment for the high ranking perpetrators and revisionist history have made it clear that a slap in the wrist was fine and they even go as far to claim that it never happen akin to saying the holocaust never happened, even at the Japanese ww2 memorial there stands a plaque which claims Nanking never happened. To this day they have never publicly apologised for it and are currently reaping the benefits as the current political aspect of Japan is still the same descendants from WW2, with even one of their ex prime ministers being a class a war criminal. Germany have changed and has completely separated itself from the early 20th century Germany while also acknowledging that they had a fucked history via apologising and righting any wrongs that could possibly right, Japan hasn\u2019t and are still the same Japanese government since before WW2. For some reason we tend to victimise Japan due to the nukes or we mislabel Japanese aggression in WW2 in a more favoured light instead of land grabs and disgusting acts of war. So yeah first time poster here but I have a strong belief that Japan needs to be held accountable and stand side by side in history with the German army of WW2."}, {"conclusion": "HD Audio 192KHz/24bit is a complete waste of space", "id": 72499, "argument": "I consider myself an audiophile.

I will not listen to music without an equalizer. Despite all of this, however, I can't figure out why anybody would seek out audio with a high sample rate or bit depth.

For those who don't know, the UK government is looking to ban single use plastics such as shopping bags, drinking straws and food containers see and These take a long time to decay naturally, and are dangerous to marine animals. Plastic drinking straws, for instance, have been found puncturing the stomachs of penguins Other options are available, but often have their limitations. For example, paper drinking straws cannot be used in hot drinks, and metal straws are dangerous for use by people with parkinsons disease I want to see the problem of plastic waste in the oceans dealt with, but I am none the less uncomfortable with the idea of banning something. It is conceivable that scientific research and innovation could reveal a way to effective clean up, and or recycle single use plastics. Boyan Slat, for instance, has developed a very promising method of cleaning up the great pacific garbage patch and an enzyme that rapidly decomposes plastic waste has recently been discovered I would be much more comfortable utilizing these technologies in a free market system to deal with the plastic waste problem. Banning single use plastics would leave the consumer with less choice, penalize the manufacturers of these plastics for providing a service that people want which to me seems very unfair , and will not change the underlying fact that people apparently want to buy single use plastic items such as drinking straws. Granted, these aren't massive problems to deal with I wouldn't really mind using the alternatives , but the principle remains that you are taking away peoples liberty at least to a small extent , but mandating what they can and cannot do with their own property be that money, raw materials used to produce single use plastics etc. . To me, this highlights a fundamental tension between sustainability and liberty You either sacrifice given amount of sustainability for liberty, or a given amount of liberty for sustainability. Again, this often isn't really a problem in practice since the amount of liberty needed to be given up for better sustainability isn't much, but in principle, it is an intractable problem and I don't know where I stand on the issue.

There are still 5 days for me to change my mind, but as it stands I want to leave the UK\u2019s economic injustice, its shoddy governance, and its establishment. I\u2019m going to go through each issue and give a brief overview of the arguments. Then I\u2019ll state why I\u2019m choosing Yes, and why I\u2019m not choosing No. Democracy \u2013 Nobody from either side argues that Westminster is without fault. On the Yes side they pretend that Westminster is bad because it projects Tory government into Scotland. On the No side they believe that Westminster can be changed for the better from within. They\u2019re both wrong. Westminster is anti democratic in other ways. Not just with the problems of the Lords, Cash for Honours and Expenses the voting system means that even when Labour gets into power, it is not because Scotland voted for it. First past the post means that there is bias towards a two party system and the main parties become inevitably more alike as they appeal to centrist, swing voters. And there is no swing in Scotland. It is mainly in the South of England. So it is no surprise that in 69 years of Westminster rule, Scottish votes changed which party received power only once, in 1974. In addition, Westminster steals our best politicians and leaves only numpties like Johann Lamont to hold the Scottish Government to account. If you think those Scottish MPs are doing a good job, over 30 of the 59 voted for benefit caps, and are straying from the ideology of their voter base. Why would we agree to that arrangement? Why, when we have the Additional Member System in Holyrood that is by voting standards pure sex, creates representative parliaments, and where coalitions force parties to adopt common sense policies everyone can agree on rather than top down ideological reorganisations? Politics \u2013 The SNP have created a myth that they are the party of progressiveness, and that independence is the stepping stone to social justice. Many no voters I\u2019ve spoken to just can\u2019t see past Alex Salmond, don\u2019t like \u201cnationalism,\u201d the word is used in the same ignorant way socialism is in the USA and have not thought about the long term consequences of independence on the political discourse. I think the argument that I\u2019ve heard that Scotland has more in common with the London dockworker than the Scottish baron is absolute nonsense. It ignores the fact Scottish and English politics is diverging. Holyrood does not draw on ethnic identity politics. It draws on Scotland\u2019s collectivism. The anti bedroom tax payment, removing charges and private investment from the NHS, community buying of privately owned land, and free university education stand in stark contrast to austerity and corporate welfare. Meanwhile, UKIP\u2019s rise guarantees that Westminster will resemble the worse kind of nationalism more than Holyrood ever could. They stress benefit thievery, not tax dodging. Immigration, not job creation. That we need to protect ourselves from Putin with Trident and from Islamists with military force. Moreover, the system entrenches establishment, widens the wealth gap and shrinks social mobility. Rather than uniting so the system can disenfranchise as it has done, Scotland is far better off walking away from the corporate agenda, not incrementally coaxing it to what it wants. Defence Foreign Policy \u2013 The SNP want rid of trident but want to join NATO, Better Together cry doom at Scotland\u2019s defence and lack of influence at the top. Jobs at Faslane could be threatened but the SNP have pledged to re employ them. We got dragged into an illegal war, and the UK\u2019s foreign policy has been nothing but bad news when it comes to the middle east. Having a smaller voice that says good things is better than a large, infinitely belligerent one. Leaving the UK is not going to change what the UK says, so if you like UK foreign policy, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s still going to be there. In addition, it will give us a seat on the EU council where the Cabinet secretary stopped the Scottish Fisheries minister from attending , when he is the person with the most influence. EU \u2013 This is an shitstorm equal to the economic arguments. Vast quantities of legal opinions on both sides. At the end of the day, given that Scotland holds 25 of the EU\u2019s renewable energy potential, 20 of the fishery stocks, and only 1 of the population of Europe, a deal will be struck. The EU can\u2019t risk looking anti democratic and it certainly won\u2019t risk those fishery stocks. It will probably take longer than the SNP claim though. Broadcasting \u2013 Anyone in doubt that Scotland needs its own broadcaster need only look at two videos. This one featuring Alex Salmond providing a 7 minute long answer to Nick Robinson\u2019s question despite him heckling. You can dispute whether he answers the second part of the question but I think it\u2019s pretty damn implicit from the content being discussed. Then watch this one featuring how it was reported. Bear in mind that this is the First Minister of Scotland. The prime minister would never be treated like that. Currency and Economics \u2013 SNP have pinned their hopes on a currency union. This will mean a provision for interest rates to be set according to both countries needs. The UK has rubbished the currency union. The economic arguments for both sides are leakier than an outbreak of diarrhoea aboard the Titanic. Every fact is disputed and amid the arse spraying mayhem an informed decision cannot be made. Unlike No voters, I no longer want to trade off social and political justice to gratify the stock market. Engorging bankers\u2019 bonuses while food banks multiply, then saying that it is the way things have to be for economic prosperity? It is an Orwellian hypocrisy. Scotland\u2019s productivity will not have changed post vote. Even if market jitters threaten share prices, it is absurd that businesses would abandon jobs they are still making profit on. Evidence of wealth in recession is easy to find the number of billionaires in India doubled in 2009 alone. The pound\u2019s wobble was not genuine concern for Scotland\u2019s future, but rather fear of existing power structures being challenged."}, {"conclusion": "Niander Wallace in Blade Runner is a necessary evil", "id": 129724, "argument": "SPOILER ALERT . . . . . .

Don't get me wrong though, I don't think Rachel Dolezal is the victim of an injustice in that matter. It may seem harsh in a liberal progressive world such as ours where individual wishes needs dreams are basically prioritized over everything else as opposed to duty, sacrifice, and every value that restrain individual freedom , but I believe that for the most part , changing your gender is a whim.

They believe there is nothing inherently bad enough about alcohol, that its use by consenting adults should be prohibited. Alcohol is probably the most dangerous drug there is for the user, and his community . People become more violent, die far more frequently, act more recklessly on alcohol than on any other drug. Alcohol is one of the few drugs where withdrawal can lead to death directly even heroin WD will not kill the user directly That is to say, if there is a line as to which drugs should be legal, one's acceptance of legal alcohol is going to be pretty hard to defend ie heroin should be illegal because it's dangerous, I would respond it is arguably not more dangerous than alcohol, see below . Alcohol poisoning overdose is incredibly easy. As I am writing this, in almost every developed nation, a consenting adult can walk into a store, and buy a single bottle, where if it's contents are imbibed, the user will as sure as he was born , die. At this point, we are going to need satisfactory justification as to why other drugs are prohibited through violent means. I believe the burden of proof is on people with an alternate viewpoint, considering the widespread uncontroversial belief that alcohol should be legal. Some people appeal to well just because one drug is legal doesn't mean we should make them all legal . First of all, this would imply that you feel alcohol is inherently bad enough to illegalize by itself if it hadn't slipped through , but no one defends this position. It is in fact, the opposite. Second of all I feel this is nonsense even in common sense terms, since we already had normal rum, but now the far more dangerous bacardi 151, and swaths of new liquor products are legally released every year. But even taking the above at face value it still requires explanation, in the face of our widespread social acceptance of precedent . The idea of precedent means, roughly, that once a ruling has been made, the reasoning is valid, and applies to similar concepts. That is, you cannot discriminate after a precedent has been set. Please disregard consequentialist defenses, although I believe the war on drugs etc. is incredibly inneffective, I don't find that particularly interesting. What I am interested in, are the justifications of those who feel that use of other drugs should be prohibited.

Increased supervision of pharmacies and users would be required, in order to guard against the possibility that medical cannabis might be sold on for recreational purposes. Although other pharmaceuticals have narcotics effects, none has the marketability, or market share of cannabis. Many legal types of pharmaceuticals already form the basis of criminal empires and this move would exacerbate that. Moreover, the increased visibility and mobility of cannabis within the economy will make it easier for determined criminals to hide or obscure the origins of cannabis produced illegally. Individual citizens will be less likely to consider cannabis use that they are victim to as being illegal. It will become harder and more expensive for the police to enforce restrictions on the use and production of cannabis for recreational purposes. It has been well argued that \u201cdrugs are not a threat to society because they are illegal; they are illegal because they are a threat to society\u201di.
