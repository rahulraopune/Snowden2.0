While you may lose some people, the kinds of people who are perturbed by intersectionality aren't the kinds of people who are willing to do the actual work required to achieve justice. Even worse, they may actively work to create a new reality that continues to oppress you and other people because it benefits them. \n\nExample: Let's say we are talking about feminism in the workplace, and my fellow white women are talking about the standard things (equal pay, maternity and paternity leave, opportunity for advancement, etc.). If I feel safe, I may mention how the dress code is written in such a way that makes me feel like I cannot wear my natural, Afrocentric hair to work. A good ally would realize that this is a component of my experience womanhood in the workplace that she did not consider and would welcome my input about how to make the workplace more inclusive regarding this issue. A bad ally say that (1) my natural hair is unprofessional and should be regulated in the workplace, (2) my issue with my hair is a black person problem, so this isn't the space to talk about it, or (3) she might feel threatened if I mention that she is privileged because she doesn't have to wear a wig or permanently damage her hair to be viewed as professional in the workplace. In a private conversation among sympathetic folks, I can explain myself and hopefully get through to a bad ally with help from good allies. If we are in a hostile environment, this can be seen as an opportunity for an non-ally to discredit me. Now, someone can say, \"I agree about equal pay for equal work, but I don't think your natural hair is presentable and Bad Ally A agrees with me and is a feminist, so I can't be racist or sexist.\"  Even worse, that bad ally may gang up on me with this person, i.e. \"Black women are always trying to make you feel bad about being white.\"\n\nThe good ally in this situation doesn't have to understand my discomfort regarding Eurocentric beauty standards or think that it is a big deal in order to at least give me the space to explain myself and the acknowledgement that my feelings are valid. That is the bare minimum. If we speak to a supervisor about our concerns, all she has to do is let me speak about my experience if she doesn't know much about it and make sure that the supervisor takes my concerns as seriously as any other member's in the coalition. \n\nBack to the original example with homophobia in the black community: I would argue that people who actually care about ending police brutality and the mass incarceration system would find other opportunities to do so if they actually felt unwelcome in certain spaces because of their homophobic views. Maybe a more religious group? Personally, I would hope that people who hold harmful views are challenged a lot, so they understand that their thinking is not above reproach. It's too easy to think that if most people I know think like me that we must be right. \n\nPersonally, I think activism doesn't hold people accountable enough and that is why we accept these partial advances as \"enough\". It is hard to acknowledge that as rotten as this system is, we all benefit from it somehow, and we all must be willing to give up some privileges in order for equality or equity to be realized. Intersectional activism forces people to reckon with the fact that they can be the oppressed and the oppressor at the same time. It is uncomfortable and scary but absolutely necessary. I will concede that it is messier than just getting back whatever the dominant voices decide are the most important issues, but I think the tension and conflict within the movement is valuable because we have seen marginalized groups feel empowered to speak up. These views have always been there, but now people are now speaking forcefully, and the powerful are listening to some degree. The balance of power is shifting, and some people aren't going to like that. Sound familiar? ",

It is hard to acknowledge that as rotten as this system is, we all benefit from it somehow, and we all must be willing to give up some privileges in order for equality or equity to be realized. Intersectional activism forces people to reckon with the fact that they can be the oppressed and the oppressor at the same time. It is uncomfortable and scary but absolutely necessary. I will concede that it is messier than just getting back whatever the dominant voices decide are the most important issues, but I think the tension and conflict within the movement is valuable because we have seen marginalized groups feel empowered to speak up. These views have always been there, but now people are now speaking forcefully, and the powerful are listening to some degree. The balance of power is shifting, and some people aren&#39;t going to like that. Sound familiar? </p>\n</div>",

That's about it -- you don't learn more about this until the prequels, the EU, and so on.\n* The Force wasn't exactly more explained in the sequels.\n\nAnd the rest really didn't need an explanation:\n\n* Greedo was a throwaway character, he's a vehicle for Han to be a ruthless brigand.\n* Luke's real father was just there as an explanation for why Luke is special. As far as we know, he's an orphan, but he's avenged his father by killing Vader (probably).\n* Vader's relationship to Obi-Wan was pretty uncomplicated.

What are they achieving that couldn&#39;t be achieved by simply having society accept that one can be a male and yet present &quot;feminine characteristics/behaviours&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>And again - not to sound rude - but how is this a matter of identity as opposed to a matter of how you perform your gender?</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a trans person still identifies with the opposite gender even if they are not performing it (and arguably even have some biological traits that align with the gender they identifiy with). </p>\n\n<p>But if a person identify with my hypothetical &quot;gender x&quot; but don&#39;t perform the &quot;feminine traits&quot; (say because society doesn&#39;t accept it), how is his gender identity any different than say a male homossexual who also refrains from performing &quot;feminine behaviours&quot; because he is afraid of how people will react?</p>\n</div>",

First of all, there are different types and severities of mental illness, just like with physical illnesses. A person with arthritis might be able to manage their condition without the kind of support that someone with crohn's requires, but both people still have chronic physical health conditions. Secondly, there's a difference between a mental illness and a condition. Something like bipolar is a mental illness. Autism isn't an illness as much as it's a way your brain works. It's useful to be able to classify autistic people not to say they're broken, but to legitimize the fact that they may function differently in society.\n\n>There is a stigma, rightfully so, against people with mental disorders. People with mental disorder diagnosis don't need to be shunned but recognized as a problem (implicitly) that can be monitored/attempted to be cured. It's just the definition.\n\nThere is a big difference between recognizing mental illness as a problem and recognizing mentally ill *people* as a problem. Mentally ill people are not a problem. They have an illness that affects their ability to function, and that illness needs to be treated in whatever ways we can to improve their quality of life. But stigma does exactly the opposite. Stigmatizing mentally ill people makes them people to fear and avoid instead of people to understand and have empathy for.\n\n>What if great minds in the past were autistic and if you were to raise them as mentally ill that they wouldn't have been able to flourish in such a productive way?

There lots of space between \"completely dysfunctional\" and \"completely neurotypical.\" Autistic people fall in this space. Classifying autism as a mental disorder or condition allows autistic people to receive the support they need *instead* of classifying them as dysfunctional.\n\nThink of it like we think of dyslexia. Before we had a term for it, dyslexic kids were just thought to be stupid. You can't read, you're dumb. But now we know that dyslexia is a real condition you can have and has no bearing on your intelligence, just your ability to read easily. So now we can develop fonts that mitigate the effects of dyslexia. We can encourage dyslexic kids to experience literature through audiobooks. We can give them extra time on tests so their grades reflect what they know instead of how long it takes them to read the question. Autism and aspergers are the same way. Instead of \"that kid flaps his hands because he's stupid/weird/uncontrollable,\" we can say \"that kid flaps his hands because he's autistic and it helps him think.\"\n\nUltimately, the solution isn't to get rid of labels, it's to remove the stigma surrounding those labels.",

I thought it was rude and presumptuous to think they knew better and had some right to bother me about their religious convictions. \n\nAs I got a little older and came to understand religion a bit better I had a revelation. They are behaving this way because they believe it to be true. This doesn't sound like much of a revelation, but when properly applied it changes your entire interpretation of why people do what they do. \n\nThe door knockers really and truly believe that they need to save my soul, and to do so knocking on my door and trying to talk is a good idea. Let me be clear here, my revelation was not about door knockers, it was about people. \n\n**Beliefs drive behaviours**\n\nNow I don't know any good ways of seeing someone's beliefs directly other than asking, but a reasonably good shortcut is to start by listening to the person and then looking at their peers in behaviour. What group did he align himself with?ISIS. What religion? Islam. And what behaviours are common in those groups? All the same behaviours he had. So there seems to be a correlation, and figuring out the direction is important. \n\nDo people who hate gays become Islamic? Do they change religion because of their hatred? If so, the hate is the cause and the religion is the consequence. But I don't think this is the case. I think that Islam holds these toxic ideals and the hate grows from that. I see people who live in Islamic countries holding these bigoted positions and bringing them with them when they move to the west. I see people taking on the faith in the west and then developing the hatred just the same as those who grew up in it. I see people who would never raise a hand to hurt another person say they don't support ISIS but I check the name of their imam and it turns out that the imam does, and so their tithing goes to support Wahhabi doctrine. \n\nSo do I think this guy was mentally ill? Maybe, but by what standard? Soldiers do terrible things in war, are they mentally ill? Sure, compared to a person in a peaceful society they appear mentally ill, but that is not how they see it. From their perspective this is a war, a struggle for control of the Earth, and this was a wartime action, an act of violence in support of that cause. I think that shows that it is more reasonable to interpret his actions as motivated by religion rather than a personal mental illness. ",

That poor kid that got arrested for bringing to school a clock he made and people panicked thinking he was a terrorist, that was taken very seriously. \n\nOh and more conspiracies \n\n>Framing MrRepzion for a bogus threat accomplishes that? Actually, it's whoever wants to stop MrRepzion from talking about professional victims. Who could that be? Given the fact that he has criticized Anita Sarkeesian...\n\nAnyone. They don't have to like Mr.Repzion, he has been \"nice\" to her occasionally in videos where he stated that no one deserves to be threatened and that could have pissed someone off where they disagreed. If not then you're literally saying that the FBI are incompetent at their jobs, oh wait you are cause feminists control everything, right right.

As for my answer, I guess it is probably the same reason why the bomb threats we (Gamergate) have received have gone unpunished - whatever reason that is, and I don't know for sure.\n\nThe major difference here is when anything threatening happens to a gator, they don't push the issue like others do so it never takes off and gets people to investigate. I said we don't know their inner workings, I'm not questioning their competence like you are.\n\n>Why would someone want to frame Anita Sarkeesian for a threat? Does it make the target feel more threatened? I don't think so, anonymous people inspire far more fear. I think it is rather obvious what was going on.\n\nYou keep thinking you got it all figured out, I won't stop you. Perhaps you could bust the case wide open for the FBI, you being so clever and privy to info and all. \n\n>We're taking the commonly used definition.\n\nAh which is? The old term was for a keyboard warrior who vied for social justice but did nothing, now it's a catch-all term for anyone you disagree with, even when people who are actively going out to fight for social justice you still call them SJW's when they're not hiding behind a keyboard like you all are. You just called Anita a SJW and she's been more active in her goals than Thunderg00f and his ranting videos while he sits on his ass and makes money off raging about her, how is he not a \"professional victim\" ?\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thunderf00t?ty=h\n\nHe makes $3k+ with each video, he says he makes science and secular videos, not raging videos about a feminist. You want facts instead of conspiracies? Go look at his analytics, his viewership was dropping, he started talking about Anita and it grew, so he kept talking about her and hasn't stopped and his channel grew from that alone, hell anyone's does now if they talk about her. Which is funny cause that's what gets her more PR so they're just shooting themselves in the foot. Morons.\n",

Why then has no one been arrested for terrorist threats? Because there are no threats. You &#39;listen and believe&#39; anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No one has been making terrorist threats. That poor kid that got arrested for bringing to school a clock he made and people panicked thinking he was a terrorist, that was taken very seriously. </p>\n\n<p>Oh and more conspiracies </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Framing MrRepzion for a bogus threat accomplishes that? Actually, it&#39;s whoever wants to stop MrRepzion from talking about professional victims. Who could that be? Given the fact that he has criticized Anita Sarkeesian...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone. They don&#39;t have to like Mr.Repzion, he has been &quot;nice&quot; to her occasionally in videos where he stated that no one deserves to be threatened and that could have pissed someone off where they disagreed. If not then you&#39;re literally saying that the FBI are incompetent at their jobs, oh wait you are cause feminists control everything, right right. You sure I&#39;m on CMV and not Conspiracy</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe this. This is to demonstrate the inconsistency in your arguments. As for my answer, I guess it is probably the same reason why the bomb threats we (Gamergate) have received have gone unpunished - whatever reason that is, and I don&#39;t know for sure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The major difference here is when anything threatening happens to a gator, they don&#39;t push the issue like others do so it never takes off and gets people to investigate. I said we don&#39;t know their inner workings, I&#39;m not questioning their competence like you are.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why would someone want to frame Anita Sarkeesian for a threat? Does it make the target feel more threatened? I don&#39;t think so, anonymous people inspire far more fear. I think it is rather obvious what was going on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You keep thinking you got it all figured out, I won&#39;t stop you. Perhaps you could bust the case wide open for the FBI, you being so clever and privy to info and all. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We&#39;re taking the commonly used definition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ah which is? The old term was for a keyboard warrior who vied for social justice but did nothing, now it&#39;s a catch-all term for anyone you disagree with, even when people who are actively going out to fight for social justice you still call them SJW&#39;s when they&#39;re not hiding behind a keyboard like you all are. You just called Anita a SJW and she&#39;s been more active in her goals than Thunderg00f and his ranting videos while he sits on his ass and makes money off raging about her, how is he not a &quot;professional victim&quot; ?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Thunderf00t?ty=h\">https://www.patreon.com/Thunderf00t?ty=h</a></p>\n\n<p>He makes $3k+ with each video, he says he makes science and secular videos, not raging videos about a feminist. You want facts instead of conspiracies? Go look at his analytics, his viewership was dropping, he started talking about Anita and it grew, so he kept talking about her and hasn&#39;t stopped and his channel grew from that alone, hell anyone&#39;s does now if they talk about her. Which is funny cause that&#39;s what gets her more PR so they&#39;re just shooting themselves in the foot. Morons.</p>\n</div>",

I have a boss who is very egotistical and paranoid and a bit of a control freak. He thrives on conflict and drama, which is a similarity I see in Trump.\n\nExample of my boss and his control freakishness: He constantly monkey's with computer controlled staff schedules and dispatch systems just because he can. He's consumed by it. The staff schedule is auto-generated by the staff picking their preferred schedule then the computer goes down the list in seniority order: person with most seniority, you get your top schedule preference. 2nd gets his if it doesn't conflict with choice of person higher in seniority. 3rd, same, on down the crew of 15 people. He'll come back and say \"I need more people on Saturday than the computer says, so you and you don't get what you picked, you do what I say now.\" Example two: We are a crew of repair people dispatched across DFW, the system will give you the next high priority tickets regardless of how far away, then if no high priority tickets exist at that moment in time then it gives you the ticket closest to your GPS coords. He'll mess that up all day long and give you something that he thinks is closer because he doesn't think it's possible to meet a high priority ticket before it misses the due time leaving a high priority customer out in the wind and put off till tomorrow. Or sometimes he'll choose something that makes you drive a long way for no reason. Both situations create ongoing arguments and resentment with his subordinates. When things don't work out he'll blame the computer system or the employee involved. Never himself.\n\nConflict: He thrives in conflict and continually does and says things to create drama. This is where he reminds me of Trump the most. He doesn't do it for the 'lols' as you are suggesting, although it seems like it. My best example of that with my boss: one day a customer from the day before that I fixed called in a second ticket. My boss was upset and wanted me and a co-worker to go out there and meet him there. I got there with my co-worker and everything was up and working according to our mobile tablets where we run tests on internet, video and phone systems, what I fixed yesterday was still fixed on the line on the outside of the house. Hey, sometimes customers just don't get it, user error, and they call again and the phone jockeys just dispatch another ticket to the field instead of working with the difficult customer. It happens. But then my boss showed up all aggressive \"Explain to me what you did yesterday.\" Two sentences in he interrupts my explanation that there is nothing broken today \"Nah, I don't want to hear that. You need to explain why this customer called again.\" I then said, but my co-worker Bob is my witness, nothing was broken again, I don't know why the customer called again, we haven't talked to them yet. \"I don't want to hear what Bob says, he's a liar like you.\"\n\nI am stunned into silence. After frowning at him with shocked anger and watching a grin slowly appear on his face, I finally said \"Now we have a different problem. Why do you think I'm a liar?\" he starts to back pedal \"Nah, Nah, Nah, we need to talk to this customer about why he called a second time.\" - I say \"NO. We have a serious problem I need cleared up according to our company's code of ethical conduct. You just called me a liar. You just called Bob a liar. Before we go or do anything else, I require an explanation. Why are we lairs?\" I wasn't yelling, it was nothing but stern anger in my voice. He has a long pause as he squints a sideways glance at me \"Come on man. I was just playin'. Let's just go talk to this customer, make sure he's ok.\" He walks to the customer's door who finally saw 3 phone trucks outside and was all \"We're here to double check on the service we provide. Jaeldi was here yesterday and I know he did an excellent job of getting the line repaired, blah blah blah.\" Everything is fine with the customer and they think my boss is a swell guy going out of his way to make sure everything is ok. \n\nAnd that's the Jeckle and Hide moment. When faced with a situation that looks like he's not going to win, he's going to lose badly, he totally dismisses his crazy outlandish accusations and proceeds like it never happened or was all just a joke. He wasn't planning on a joke. He was planning on a conflict, a battle to win, to stoke his ego. When that wasn't going to happen, he slid over to another perspective that dismisses it all. \n\nAnd this is what I think Trump does. He's all self centered Ego just like my boss. But he's not dumb, he's very intelligent. But that ego ruins his intelligence badly. The intelligence will save him from the utter collapse when balloons pop. Jump over to another balloon. Float along on that conflict and drama. They'll always be another balloon. They'll always be another loser to lord over.\n\nTo be a total nerd, I am reminded of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Kahn when in the Battle in the Mutara Nebula speaking of Kahn, Spock says \"He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate he lacks experience\". For my boss and Trump I would alter that statement slightly: He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate a lack of self awareness of his own ego and an emotional need for conflict and drama. He has to feel like he's winning and someone else is losing or is a loser or he feels insecure. \n\nIt can be pretty unsettling being around someone that does outlandish things that defy common sense but it is all Ego, not a planned joke, running that engine. \n\nSorry that was so long.

Why do you think I&#39;m a liar?&quot; he starts to back pedal &quot;Nah, Nah, Nah, we need to talk to this customer about why he called a second time.&quot; - I say &quot;NO. We have a serious problem I need cleared up according to our company&#39;s code of ethical conduct. You just called me a liar. You just called Bob a liar. Before we go or do anything else, I require an explanation. Why are we lairs?&quot; I wasn&#39;t yelling, it was nothing but stern anger in my voice. He has a long pause as he squints a sideways glance at me &quot;Come on man. I was just playin&#39;. Let&#39;s just go talk to this customer, make sure he&#39;s ok.&quot; He walks to the customer&#39;s door who finally saw 3 phone trucks outside and was all &quot;We&#39;re here to double check on the service we provide. Jaeldi was here yesterday and I know he did an excellent job of getting the line repaired, blah blah blah.&quot; Everything is fine with the customer and they think my boss is a swell guy going out of his way to make sure everything is ok. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s the Jeckle and Hide moment. When faced with a situation that looks like he&#39;s not going to win, he&#39;s going to lose badly, he totally dismisses his crazy outlandish accusations and proceeds like it never happened or was all just a joke. He wasn&#39;t planning on a joke. He was planning on a conflict, a battle to win, to stoke his ego. When that wasn&#39;t going to happen, he slid over to another perspective that dismisses it all. </p>\n\n<p>And this is what I think Trump does. He&#39;s all self centered Ego just like my boss. But he&#39;s not dumb, he&#39;s very intelligent. But that ego ruins his intelligence badly. The intelligence will save him from the utter collapse when balloons pop. Jump over to another balloon. Float along on that conflict and drama. They&#39;ll always be another balloon. They&#39;ll always be another loser to lord over.</p>\n\n<p>To be a total nerd, I am reminded of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Kahn when in the Battle in the Mutara Nebula speaking of Kahn, Spock says &quot;He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate he lacks experience&quot;. For my boss and Trump I would alter that statement slightly: He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate a lack of self awareness of his own ego and an emotional need for conflict and drama. He has to feel like he&#39;s winning and someone else is losing or is a loser or he feels insecure. </p>\n\n<p>It can be pretty unsettling being around someone that does outlandish things that defy common sense but it is all Ego, not a planned joke, running that engine. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry that was so long. Thanks for reading. </p>\n</div>",

(Maybe this was a bad example idk) \n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily follow. It\u2019s possible for abortion to be legal, but extremely rare due to high education and contraception. So yes, it was not a great example.\n\n>But here is my question. Do you want everyone to have the same view as you?\n\nI would love to have most people share large ethical views such as \u201cslavery is wrong\u201d or \u201cwomen are people\u201d. Both of these views are widely accepted now but not historically. \n\nI don\u2019t care if people have different tastes (which are the most delicious food). Tastes are preferences, and they rarely affect others. \n\n>I argue that if everyone had the same views that many aspects of society would not advance.\n\nYou didn\u2019t actually provide any support for this. If everyone agreed abortion is bad or good, how would that prevent society from \u201cadvancing\u201d and advancing towards what?\n\n>Lastly we call people out for getting angry when we question their views. But we get upset when people question ours.\n\nI think this is more a call to avoid being irrationally invested in our views and for dispassionate debate, rather than an end to debate.

There would be less consequences to unprotected sex, (possibly) more std transfer would occure. (Maybe this was a bad example idk) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily follow. It\u2019s possible for abortion to be legal, but extremely rare due to high education and contraception. So yes, it was not a great example.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But here is my question. Do you want everyone to have the same view as you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would love to have most people share large ethical views such as \u201cslavery is wrong\u201d or \u201cwomen are people\u201d. Both of these views are widely accepted now but not historically. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t care if people have different tastes (which are the most delicious food).

When your reaction to hearing people talk about racism is \"White people feel it too,\" you're *shifting the conversation back to white people*.  You're taking an issue that you admit affects non-whites far more strongly and recentering it on yourself.  \n\nAnd I can't get around the belief that you're motivated to do this because you feel like this \"racism\" thing is a magic special way of being evil that only applies to White people, and that's unfair.

While it is one that might even be almost statistically accurate, it's still a generalization. You just can't speak for every person of a race.\n\nSee the part I italicized in the quote there?  That kind of language still implies to me that you're hearing \"racism\" as a character judgment... you're focused on individual hearts and individual actions rather than structural trends.  If you're talking about a society, it's unnecessary to say \"most white people,\" because everything's probabilistic on the macro.\n\nLet me put it this way: In your OP you talk about jokes, and you say how you can make a 'racist' joke and not MEAN it, and that's importantly different from if you do mean it.  In judging the person's character, that makes sense.  But it's completely irrelevant if you're not talking about that and instead you're talking about things that strengthen racist structures implicitly, across people, and as a trend.",

When your reaction to hearing people talk about racism is &quot;White people feel it too,&quot; you&#39;re <em>shifting the conversation back to white people</em>.  You&#39;re taking an issue that you admit affects non-whites far more strongly and recentering it on yourself.  </p>\n\n<p>And I can&#39;t get around the belief that you&#39;re motivated to do this because you feel like this &quot;racism&quot; thing is a magic special way of being evil that only applies to White people, and that&#39;s unfair.  But not only is that (probably) missing the point, it&#39;s putting the experience of being privileged in a culture up against being marginalized in a culture and implying they&#39;re just as bad as one another.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all white people enact behaviors like that though. A lot do, sure. Amen to that. But not all of them. Saying that is equivocal to saying that <em>not a single white person acts good enough in regards to racial relations.</em> It&#39;s not a threat, it only bugs me because I feel that it is incorrect. While it is one that might even be almost statistically accurate, it&#39;s still a generalization. You just can&#39;t speak for every person of a race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the part I italicized in the quote there?  That kind of language still implies to me that you&#39;re hearing &quot;racism&quot; as a character judgment... you&#39;re focused on individual hearts and individual actions rather than structural trends.  If you&#39;re talking about a society, it&#39;s unnecessary to say &quot;most white people,&quot; because everything&#39;s probabilistic on the macro.</p>\n\n<p>Let me put it this way: In your OP you talk about jokes, and you say how you can make a &#39;racist&#39; joke and not MEAN it, and that&#39;s importantly different from if you do mean it.  In judging the person&#39;s character, that makes sense.  But it&#39;s completely irrelevant if you&#39;re not talking about that and instead you&#39;re talking about things that strengthen racist structures implicitly, across people, and as a trend.</p>\n</div>",

The muscle loss cannot simply be countered by working out extra hard.  Testosterone is a vital hormone for building and maintaining muscle mass.  Most transgender women end up with even less testosterone than ciswomen due to the removal of their androgen producing gonads.  Their natural steroids are basically gone.

The muscle loss cannot simply be countered by working out extra hard.  Testosterone is a vital hormone for building and maintaining muscle mass.  Most transgender women end up with even less testosterone than ciswomen due to the removal of their androgen producing gonads.  Their natural steroids are basically gone.

                "body": ">As you can see, where you end up depends on temperature and carbon. The higher phase (red steels) are much weaker. At the temperature of jet fuel, the steel would be less than half as strong as it is cold. That, combined with the force of impact, and the thermal expansion, fatally compromised the structure.\n\nYou (and really every explanation Ive ever read) neglects a huge effect:  Heat transfer.  Im not sure why most explanations forego the modeling of heat transver, but it is a HUGE red flag in every 9/11 explanation (official or unofficial) that I have ever seen.\n\nThe fact that Jet fuel burns at (whatever) degrees is really irrelevant. The issue is getting the heat energy from the fireball to the structure that is to be heated (steel in this case).  When the plane hit the tower, the jet fuel exploded in a huge fireball.  Most of the heat in the jet fuel went into heating the AIR surrounding the tower, as well as the few floors the tower hit.  Some of it must have sprayed/burned onto the core columns, but to raise the temperature of the core columns to the fuel's burning temperature would require a STEADY and CONSTANT supply of fuel.  Why?  Because it takes time for things to change temperature.  If you don't believe me, please google \"Heat Transfer\".  Hint:  Its why you dont get a burn if you touch a pot of boiling water for a split second, but you will if you touch it for longer.\n\nNow lets look at a simple energy calculation, and assume the WORST POSSIBLE case scenario, which checks the claim that the steel was weakened due to the high heat.  And I mean worst case:  I am going to assume all energy from fuel goes into heating the buildings steel, and not heating the air/furniture/concrete/office supplies: \n\nLets assume you took the **fuel contained in a fully loaded 767 (152616.46L)**, and painted it evenly across EACH AND EVERY steel column that supported the WTC (since all of the columns came tumbling down, not just the parts that were hit by the plane/fireball).\n\n**Jet feul has an energy density of 35MJ/L**, giving the tank a chemical potential energy of **5.3415761E12 Joules.**  **Steel has a specific heat capacity of 450 J/(KG*degree_C)**\n\nNow, we light the steel and burn the fuel.  Now, even assuming that ALL the energy in the fuel went into heating the metal and none went into heating the air (obviously not true but since this is a \"worst-possible\" case), this would heat up the structural steel:\n\n5.3415761E12 Joules/(450J/(KG degree_C) x 181436948KG) = **65.4 degrees C**\n\nNot nearly enough to weaken the beams.\n\nBut what about the kinetic energy of the plane, you ask?  It is quite irrelevant given the amount of energy in the fuel.  But just for completeness:\n\nMass of 767 (maximum possible takeoff weight):  **179168.986KG**\n\nVelocity: **500mph** (this would be impossible at 1500ft above ground because the dense air would tear the plane apart, but again, assuming the worst)\n\nThis adds an extra **4475747911.66J** of energy.  Assuming the plane disintegrated itself and its kinetic energy evenly distributed itself across the steel (again, sugn a ridiculous assumption, but \"worst case\"), the new change in temp of the steel would be:\n\n(5.3415761E12+4475747911.66)/(450J/(KG degree_C) x 181436948) = **65.5 degrees C**\n\nNow this was the absolute worst case scenario, assuming many things for the sake of trying to prove the official theory that the steel was weakened.  This still isn't what actually happened, so don't call this a theory - it just disproves the ridiculous official theory.\n\nYou would probably tell me:  The Fuel exploded across only a few floors - so there could have been sufficient heat transferred to the floors around the crash site to weaken the steel there.  Plus there were fires.  And this is absolutely true.  But then why didn't only the top of the building fall?  Why did the bottom 80+ floors also collapse - steel melted and concrete turned to dirt - if the jet fuel didnt \"weaken\" those areas?  \n\nIf your answer is that the impact of the plane made the building vibrate and weakened the steel you are wrong.  Impact damage (opposed to fatigue damage) is instant.  Furthermore, if the impact did hurt the structural integrity of the steel, you would see it as soon as the plane hit - that is, the building would have broken apart rigt away (likely at or below impact location, since the maximum stresses applied to the building by the impact occur at the impact location and near the base of the building; however we know without calculation that the pane has nowhere near enough momentum to generate the stresses needed to tear the building at its base).  But instantaneous collapse didn't happen, and the idea of something as (relatively) small as a plane traveling at a few hundred miles an hour breaking a bldg as big as the WTC is just stupid. I would even venture to say its impossible, since the plane body is not very strong compared to the building.\n\nFYI, I study failures of materials due to dynamic, static, or thermal loading.  I work in a research lab that analyzes material failures that start at the mollecular level and propagate through until the entire material cracks.  The tough part of failure analysis is understanding the forces/dynamics/heat exchange/electric flow of the atoms/mollecules that make up material we otherwise think of as solid.  After you know that, it is just simulating those forces and seeing what happens.  In the case of the WTC, the dynamics at play are readily known and available - everything is on such a large scale.  Coming from my background, it is very obvious that the WTC could not have been brought down by a plane and jet fuel.\n\nEDIT: /u/GonzotheGreat89 I see a lot of non-scientists in here.  I'm a material failure engineer, my posts are not regurgitation off of \"conspiracy\" sites or anything.  This shit is what I work on every day.  Feel free to ask anything else.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, where you end up depends on temperature and carbon. The higher phase (red steels) are much weaker. At the temperature of jet fuel, the steel would be less than half as strong as it is cold. That, combined with the force of impact, and the thermal expansion, fatally compromised the structure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You (and really every explanation Ive ever read) neglects a huge effect:  Heat transfer.  Im not sure why most explanations forego the modeling of heat transver, but it is a HUGE red flag in every 9/11 explanation (official or unofficial) that I have ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Jet fuel burns at (whatever) degrees is really irrelevant. The issue is getting the heat energy from the fireball to the structure that is to be heated (steel in this case).  When the plane hit the tower, the jet fuel exploded in a huge fireball.  Most of the heat in the jet fuel went into heating the AIR surrounding the tower, as well as the few floors the tower hit.  Some of it must have sprayed/burned onto the core columns, but to raise the temperature of the core columns to the fuel&#39;s burning temperature would require a STEADY and CONSTANT supply of fuel.  Why?  Because it takes time for things to change temperature.  If you don&#39;t believe me, please google &quot;Heat Transfer&quot;.

We're not talking about just living indefinitely long, replacing organs as you go and whatnot, but instead I should be able to name any time in the future and you'll still be around. Let's take a look at what that will take. \n\n**100 years**: I'll assume you're in your early twenties right now so I have a number to work with. The longest living person that I'm aware of was [Jeanne Calment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment) who lived to the age of 122. So, if you want to live another 100 years, you could maybe do it just with good genes and good luck. We're only looking for a non-zero chance, so we're doing good so far. \n\n**200 years**: Congratulations! You've lived another 200 years and managed to break all records of human lifespan previously known. To get to this point unprecedented medical advances have been made. New organs can be grown replaced as you need them, and methods have been devised to keep your brain cells healthy, or at least to replace them bit by bit. Or maybe you do get a brain replacement every now and then, but your old memories, personality, intelligence, etc. are imprinted on it. Would that still count as you? For the sake of argument let's say sure, why not. \n\nAlmost as important as the advances in medical technology is your access to it. Perhaps this tech is available only to the rich and influential, or maybe it's so cheap and easy everyone can use it. In any case, you've managed to discover the fountain of youth, and you have a long life ahead of you.\n\n**10,000 years**: A lot has changed in your lifetime. You're one of the oldest humans alive, having been lucky enough to be in the first generation that had access to effective immortality. Aging and disease are distant memories. You've managed to live through the strife caused by the end of death. Perhaps that elixir of immortality is available to only a select few, or perhaps humanity has spread beyond Earth to cope with an ever-growing population, or maybe childbirth is strictly controlled. Whatever happened society lives on, and you with it. \n\n**100,000 years**: You've managed to go a thousand centuries without your head getting crushed under the back wheels of a bus. Kudos. \n\n**1,000,000 years**: A million years. Wow. How much memory can the human mind hold, anyway? Do you remember your childhood, your first kiss, the face of your parents? Perhaps you have some sort of external memory. How recognizable would you be now to yourself in the year 2013AD? Are you still human, even? Whatever you are, let's say that you're still you, and you've lived this long. \n\nYou've seen the rise and fall of countless civilizations. Most of human history is in your mind. The invention of agriculture and the city happened a mere 10,000 years before you were born; at this point, that's pretty much a rounding error in your age. \n\n**10^9 years**: The Earth is about 5.54 billion years old now. You've been around for 18% of that. When you were born there had been five major mass extinction events in Earth's history. Has another one happened by now? Perhaps a giant comet or meteor has struck the Earth in your lifetime, shrouding it in a cloud of debris that blocked the sun. Maybe a nearby star went super nova and bathed the Earth in gamma radiation, driving you and everyone else underground. Whatever has or hasn't happened, humanity must have god-like technology by now for you to have survived this long. We're definitely in the realm of science fiction now, but you said 100% certainty, so why not? \n\n**3 x 10^9 years**: The Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda galaxy merge. You've seen Andromeda grow in the night sky from the little smudge it is today to a giant, sky filling wonder. Don't worry, galaxies are mostly empty space, so it's very unlikely that our sun will be hit by another star. You and whoever else is around will have to think of a name for the new galaxy that forms. \n\n**5 x 10^9 years**: You're about half as old as the Earth now and the sun is dying. As it burns through its hydrogen fuel it begins to fuse helium and heavier elements. The sun expands and swallows up the planet Mercury, then Venus. You had better hope that there was a well funded space program sometime in the last few billion years because Earth is not a fun place right now. The oceans have boiled away and the surface is a scorched desert, to say the least. At noon the giant, red sun fills the entire sky from horizon to horizon. Hopefully you've invested in a nice retirement home on Europa. \n\n(continued)\n",

Has the problem of traveling faster than light ever been solved? Can you zip between stars with your warp drive, or do you just accept that trip will take a while? You've certainly got the time to travel, and if you're going at relativistic speeds it doesn't even seem to take that long to you. By now lots of good books have likely been written, so hopefully you'll have something to keep yourself busy on your voyages between stars. \n\n**10^11 years**: The galaxies in the Local Group begin to merge together into one giant galaxy. Guess you'll have to come up with yet another galaxy name. \n\n**10^12 years**: Half-Life 3 is released. It doesn't live up to your expectations. \n\n**2 x 10^12 years**: Remember how you had to keep coming up with galaxy names? Well, the universe is constantly expanding and all other galaxies have receded beyond the edge of the observable universe. So, since there's only galaxy sitting in the middle of a black emptiness that stretches billions of light years in each direction it seems kind of redundant to bother naming it. When you meet new alien lifeforms and civilizations you try to tell them that the universe used to be full of galaxies just like the one you're in now, but it seems a little farfetched to them. \n\n**3 x 10^12 years**: You and whatever's left of humanity and the other races you've met clearly have amazing powers to have lasted this long. You may as well get a hobby. Why not find a planet with primitive intelligent life and convince them you're God? Get a few friends together and get followers on different continents, and see whose worshipers dominate the world. Best RTS ever. \n\n**10^14 years**: Star formation ceases. The stars that currently exist burn out one by one, leaving dimly glowing dwarf stars, fast spinning pulsars, black holes, etc. The night sky (assuming you're even on a planet right now) grows darker with each passing aeon as the stars wink out of existence. You've been around a long time, and you start to feel an emotion you almost forgot the existence of; an existential fear of your ultimate fate. \n\n**10^15 years**: You're having a hard time finding a welcoming planet. The ones that haven't fallen into their parent stars have been flung into interstellar space, drifting forever in the cold darkness. Perhaps you and what's left of the other intelligent races have undertaken a massive engineering project to keep the light of life burning in a dying universe. You and the others build an artificial star at the centre of a Dyson sphere, a solar system sized construct surrounding your new sun. This is the last bastion of civilization and intelligent life, a flickering candle in the infinite darkness. Memories of everything and everyone that ever was is stored in vast libraries. You and the other immortals try to discover new physics to stave off the inevitable. \n\n**10^18 years**: You stare into the abyss, wondering if there are other bastions of civilization like yours that exist beyond the edge of the observable universe. \n\n**10^20 years**: Similar to the fate of the planets, stellar remnants are flung from the galaxy or begin falling into black holes. The One Galaxy grows smaller and denser, increasing the speed of this process. You and the Immortals are mindful of this and carefully plot the trajectory of your home. Perhaps you're somehow finding fuel for it to keep the star at its centre burning, or maybe you have to keep making new ones. As the last galaxy dies, you're concerned that you can't keep this up forever. You continue your study of physics; no new discoveries have been made in aeons, but you keep looking for loop-holes in the laws of nature that might save you. Many others have decided this is futile and have accepted their fate, leaving your collective to drift lifeless among the remains of the stars. You press on. \n\n**10^40 years**: You know protons, one of the subatomic particles that (along with neutrons and electrons) make up the atoms and molecules of all matter that you interact with? Most of them are gone by now, having decayed away in a slow but inevitable process. All regular matter that's left is a rare resource. If you've somehow, miraculously, against all odds made it to this point, you're most likely alone. Everything is cold, dark, empty, unforgiving. \n\n**10^100 years**: All that's left in the universe is you (somehow) and black holes. How are you even still alive? The vast majority of your existence, so much so that everything else is barely even worth mentioning, has just been you floating in darkness with nothing but black holes for company. Even they are starting to vanish as they evaporate through Hawking radiation, shrinking in mass and then winking out of existence. \n\n**Beyond**: There are still some photons, electrons, and other things flying about, but the universe is so vast and empty that they hardly ever interact with each other. It's uncertain what the future holds at this point, but you won't be around to see it. Some of the electrons that were once part of you are still around I suppose, somewhere, but it's impossible at this point that anything that could be considered \"you\" could remain. Perhaps other universes exist or will come into existence, and if there are an infinity of them then some entity very much like you could very will exist in them, but the \"you\" that you are now will be gone, irrecoverably, forever. The light of life in the universe has guttered and been extinguished. \n\n**tl;dr: Maybe you can beat cancer and AIDS and aging and go live among the stars, but you'll never escape entropy.**\n\nEdit: This has been linked in a couple of places and is generating a lot of interesting discussion.

There doesn&#39;t need to be a special election. If the will of the people had been to give the democrats the house, then it would&#39;ve been their speaker. It has zilch to do with Trump, the Russians, or the like.  The line was changed specifically to keep the president from appointing his successor through his cabinet.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s set up for the speaker and then the president pro tempore. Ryan and Hatch are elected officials and picked by their peers in the majority to have that position </p>\n</div>",

Also, the guy in the actual court case wasn't fired because he's gay, he was fired because a customer complained about his behavior to his employer. I know it doesn't seem too much of a difference for those who want to lie that he was fired for being gay, but it's a huge difference for anyone who cares about the truth.\n\n> It is absolutely discriminatory and bigoted to pass a blanket ban on ALL transpeople\n\nYeah, just like it's discriminatory for the military to pass a blanket ban on ALL quadriplegics, schizophrenics, and so on. Your point being? What you don't seem to understand, or rather, what you want to lie about, is that trans people are not banned from the military for the sole fact that their genders don't match the sex they were born with. Nobody gives a curly fuck about that, including Trump. **We don't care**. They are banned because 1. statistically speaking they pose a higher risk than others as they are prone to mental problems which is an absolute no-no in the military; 2. the LGBT activists (pretending to represent trans soldiers who never asked for it) keep on demanding stuff the military doesn't want to pay for, quite justifiably. Maybe, just maybe, if the LGBT activists stopped demanding insane bullshit like sex change operations paid by the taxpayer, the military wouldn't view trans people as a burden. Maybe you guys have overplayed your hand and normal people are fed up with your antics. And let me make this abundantly clear as I know you will have a sudden urge to misrepresent what I've just said: our problem is **not** with trans people, it's with SJW activists who stir shit up constantly in the name of others. In this case the conclusion is that SJW activists have fucked trans people over because they spewed so much bullshit the military got annoyed and solved the problem permanently.\n\n> What Trump called for was a ban on ANY transperson\n\nYou do realize, right, that nobody can tell if anyone else is trans until they self-report it, so for all intents and purposes every single employee of the US military can be trans as long as they don't make a fuss about it...? This move wasn't designed to hurt trans people whose shiniest dream is to be a soldier (like, 3 people in the US), it was designed to curb the SJW bullshit.\n\n> The fact that Trump is banning these people SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE they are trans is bigotry plain and simple\n\nYeah, and banning triple amputees SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE they're triple amputees is bigotry plain and simple. I can't decide if I should admire your pure hatred for something you don't understand and thus need to lie about constantly to justify your hatred of it, or be afraid that if this shit spreads any further your kind will begin murdering innocents and start a fuckin' civil war. You're a menace to civilized society.\n\n> Was I talking about Hillary and Obama? No.\n\nIt's hilarious that when your side does something it's perfectly fine but when the other side does the exact same thing it's horrendous. Hypocrite much? Also, just to make it clear, what your side did was waaaay worse, you armed ISIS and destabilized Libya and Syria, Trump just wants to clean up this mess.\n\n> whether Trump has expressed support for dictators who murder gay people, and the fact is: he has.\n\nI doubt he ever expressed support for islamic dictators considering YOU GUYS bashed him for being anti-islam ever since he started his presidential campaign.\n\nAlso, please explain Linda Sarsour to me, or more specifically how an insane jew-hating LGBT-loathing wannabe terrorist jihad-freak can be a de facto spokeswoman for the democratic party in the US?

It's also important to note, that depending on the translation, homosexuality may be referred to as \"an abomination\" and carry a sentence of *death*.

They're irrelevant to your day-to-day interactions. You don't care about them when talking to your best friend, you don't interrogate them talking to that cute girl on the corner, you don't ask your teachers for their karotype. There's a pretty good chance you've never even seen your own chromosomes in any capacity. So as a 'technical standpoint', it's not really useful or valuable for guiding, or even making *sense* of, our day-to-day interactions. We judge and interact based on surface level cues, and that's okay.\n\n>mutilated \n\nThat's kind of a strong word. It implies that their vagina is damaged, bloody, torn apart, violated, etc. But that's not really the case. It probably looks fine as far as vaginas go, to the point where for some trans women dudes cannot even tell the difference, which is a far cry from being 'mutilated'. \n\nAs an analogy, we might think of plastic surgery. If a child is born with a cleft lip, and elects for surgery to make it less obvious (To the point of being virtually unnoticeable), would you say that they still have a mutilated, albeit camouflaged, face? Is a woman who elects to plastic surgery on her nose left with a mutilated nose? Unlikely. We might say it was unnecessary or driven by vanity, but I know of very few people who would consider her face to be mutilated. I can understand why people might see transgender surgeries as 'mutilation', but it seems to be a rather strict double standard given how we treat other conditions.

You don&#39;t care about them when talking to your best friend, you don&#39;t interrogate them talking to that cute girl on the corner, you don&#39;t ask your teachers for their karotype. There&#39;s a pretty good chance you&#39;ve never even seen your own chromosomes in any capacity. So as a &#39;technical standpoint&#39;, it&#39;s not really useful or valuable for guiding, or even making <em>sense</em> of, our day-to-day interactions. We judge and interact based on surface level cues, and that&#39;s okay.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>mutilated </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s kind of a strong word. It implies that their vagina is damaged, bloody, torn apart, violated, etc. But that&#39;s not really the case. It probably looks fine as far as vaginas go, to the point where for some trans women dudes cannot even tell the difference, which is a far cry from being &#39;mutilated&#39;. </p>\n\n<p>As an analogy, we might think of plastic surgery. If a child is born with a cleft lip, and elects for surgery to make it less obvious (To the point of being virtually unnoticeable), would you say that they still have a mutilated, albeit camouflaged, face? Is a woman who elects to plastic surgery on her nose left with a mutilated nose? Unlikely. We might say it was unnecessary or driven by vanity, but I know of very few people who would consider her face to be mutilated. I can understand why people might see transgender surgeries as &#39;mutilation&#39;, but it seems to be a rather strict double standard given how we treat other conditions. To say nothing of how loaded that word is.</p>\n</div>",

If you want to drive someone away, that&#39;s a great start.</p>\n</div>",

To be aware of gender biases and work to declaw or ignore them.\n\nThere's no doubt that patriarchy hurts men too.

Your post did not disappoint! \n\nThat is interesting to hear there were designated areas for certain aspects of the Portland protests. I've been to LOTS of the protests in DC and that does seem to be evidence of a more cohesive group that is actively organizing. I don't think the evidence of masks and costumes is evidence of the antifa per se, as I'll believe this will be a common protesting tactic moving forward due to the growth and increased use of facial recognition. \n\nIn the videos you posted, I saw nothing unique or different from any other protest I've attended. Maybe I missed it, but there seemed to be nothing that indicated antifa presence. No visible signs or audible cues. I'm glad to see there was police presence given that we know that those Portland protests definitely got violent and destructive. \n\nIf you have recruitment websites I'd love to be PM'd. I won't post it, but it would go a long way towards me providing a delta. Thank you for acting responsibly. \n\n",

I don&#39;t think the evidence of masks and costumes is evidence of the antifa per se, as I&#39;ll believe this will be a common protesting tactic moving forward due to the growth and increased use of facial recognition. </p>\n\n<p>In the videos you posted, I saw nothing unique or different from any other protest I&#39;ve attended. Maybe I missed it, but there seemed to be nothing that indicated antifa presence. No visible signs or audible cues. I&#39;m glad to see there was police presence given that we know that those Portland protests definitely got violent and destructive. </p>\n\n<p>If you have recruitment websites I&#39;d love to be PM&#39;d. I won&#39;t post it, but it would go a long way towards me providing a delta. Thank you for acting responsibly. </p>\n</div>",

Truth is, most of Western Europe is extremely little diversity - their minorities do not compete for resources at all with the majority. And I also disagree with your point that they are treating minorities better. Burkha and burkini bans for starters. India is far more tolerant and accepting of various religious practices of minorities.\n\nBurka and bikini burkini bans are in small pockets of france only. Burkha ban is for public safety, not religious discrimination. Please source me saying it is religious discrimination. \n\n> You have chosen to take an extremely narrow viewpoint. The various examples I gave are about India treating minorities despite facing far more severe and far more extreme challenges. Your original statement about \"being treated better\" is always about context, although you reject all attempts at context setting. For example, if you were born to a rich family with access to lots of resources VS being born to a poor family with access to limited resources, then it is incorrect to make your statement without taking the context into account.\n\nContext is important to how people treat minorities. It doesn't change my CMV though. You are just going off tangents. \n\n> Yes, I do have a basic understanding of Indian history. Like I said, you are the one who has cleverly chosen to shoehorn yourself into a very narrow niche. So I guess it all depends what your definition of \"history\" is. Do you mean \"history\" as it applies after the year 2000?\nYou can't have your cake and eat it too. If you are going to bring up Indian history, then you need to bring up Western history too, and its track record. And you can't just arbitrarily put a line on the year 2000 because it better suits your POV.\n\nI defined my parameters for the CMV. You can take it or leave it. \n\n\n> And if you are going to bring up Modi, then you need to answer your own question - what specific policies has Modi implemented after he became the Prime Minister of India, that have been anti-minority?\n\nModi is well known Hindu Nationalist. Hate crimes against Muslims have gone up substantially since he took office. A specific law for example is his implementation of banning the slaughter of beef. This is imposing a Hindu religious law onto religious minorities that infringes on their beliefs. They are denying Muslim people from eating what they want. This also is obviously a targeted attack against Muslims. If you are of the opinion that Modi isn't a Hindu Nationalist and the BJP isn't interested in marginalizing Muslims, I'm not sure what to tell you. \n\n\n> And Islam-Hindu clashes have to be put in perspective of the overall population. Considering the population of Western European countries, and considering the number of Muslims living there, I argue that they are actually being treated far worse - in terms of percentage of incidents per population.\n\nPlease provide your proof for this. France has not had one incident of killing a Muslim person because they are Muslim. If this is not the case please feel free to provide an example.\n\n\nCompare that to the Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat for example, where around 1,000 Muslims were killed. So please provide your statistical analysis for your statement. \n\n> Have you even looked at the problems France has faced for decades in trying (and failing) to integrate Muslims and specifically African-Muslims and Middle Eastern Muslims into its society? India is honestly a way better example than France in this regard, even if you take the religious riots and unrests into account.\n\nnot one person has been killed in France because they are Muslim. hundreds have been killed in India because they are Muslim. \n\n\n> Like I said, I genuinely believe that Muslims in India are treated far better, on average, than Muslims in France are being treated or have been treated in the last couple of decades. Korea and Japan are bad examples, if anything, they are more like Scandinavian countries. They don't even know what immigration and minority means. Their countries and their societies are that insular and uni-dimensional.\n\nPlease provide your proof for this. 1,000 people died alone in 2002. In the past 2 years multiple Muslims have been killed by Hindu Nationalists and mob lynchings. Please find similar cases in Western countries. ",

So please provide your statistical analysis for your statement. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have you even looked at the problems France has faced for decades in trying (and failing) to integrate Muslims and specifically African-Muslims and Middle Eastern Muslims into its society? India is honestly a way better example than France in this regard, even if you take the religious riots and unrests into account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>not one person has been killed in France because they are Muslim. hundreds have been killed in India because they are Muslim. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like I said, I genuinely believe that Muslims in India are treated far better, on average, than Muslims in France are being treated or have been treated in the last couple of decades. Korea and Japan are bad examples, if anything, they are more like Scandinavian countries. They don&#39;t even know what immigration and minority means. Their countries and their societies are that insular and uni-dimensional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please provide your proof for this. 1,000 people died alone in 2002. In the past 2 years multiple Muslims have been killed by Hindu Nationalists and mob lynchings. Please find similar cases in Western countries. </p>\n</div>",

                "body": "First, it's important to say that your argument is that \"in general, Republicans are hypocrites\", which implies to me that a majority of Republicans are hypocrites. So that's about half of the [23-40% of \"Republicans\"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx). That's probably at least 40,000,000 people. That's a weighty accusation, and you'd probably have had a more defensible position if you argued that some Republican views were hypocritical, because then you might actually have a bunch of Republicans agreeing.\n\nSecond, Republicans are a party. Since we have two parties that capture the majority of votes in the country, their platforms will, by necessity, be structured in such a way as to try to rope in a lot of people. Republicans now have at least three clear ideological factions to my eye, those being traditional Goldwater conservatives, tea-party conservatives, and socially conservative religious voters. Those factions don't even necessarily agree on everything (or anything). So, knowing that many Republicans don't even agree with their party's views -- they simply prefer it to the alternative because they highly value some small subset -- are you still comfortable asserting that so many people are, individually, hypocrites?\n\nThat said, to address the actual points:\n\nPoint #1: Republicans do lay a clam to being a party of small government. However, everything you've cited as examples of government intervention are questions for which Republicans are morally motivated. Let's imagine someone who believes that law and order and protecting the innocent are proper functions of the government; and that intervening economically to help people who can't help themselves is a function better left to charity. This mindset can easily result in a consistent philosophy that wants the government to intervene when there are victims - whether that is the people who suffer from drug trade, the unborn child/fetus of the woman who wants an abortion, or the invalid who has a right to life even if his spouse wants to end life support. I'm not making an argument that any of these things are immoral. (I even used two terms in the abortion because even the terminology of abortion is completely loaded.)\n\nThe reality is, we all have a set of moral beliefs, and we all, in general, believe that the government should legislate morality. Sometimes these beliefs are extremely contentious - such as abortion. Other times, there are times when society as a whole has no problem overriding someone's individual choices (for example, we'd generally not be shy about overriding a parent's choice to withhold antibiotics from a sick child, because they believed healing not based on faith was an affront to God).\n\nKeeping in mind that many Republicans in the faction of the religiously motivated voters don't even particularly **care** about economic policy, realize that when they push for candidates to oppose gay marriage, they are doing it strictly out of a sense that it is a sinful act and inherently immoral, and on that grounds, they feel it is not only acceptable but **necessary** for the government to protect society. I don't at all agree, but it doesn't make them hypocrites. Meanwhile, they quite likely care very little for economic policy - or, at most, they have a vague feeling that the government is large and wasteful, but don't particularly care about the details because they're voting their morality on social issues regardless.\n\nWhat I'd say is that you are seeing their platform views through your own lens. Truth be told, I've used that exact same argument before, because I think it **is** persuasive to the non-religious Republican. (I also think the fractured factions of the Republicans are responsible for their being unable to play their role in government effectively, and will ultimately lead to a decline in the party or some sort of platform \"purge\" that will marginalize at least one of the competing factions.)\n\nPoint #2: (Some) Republicans believe that higher taxes stifle growth, especially on people who have money to invest. This is [supply-side economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_side_economics) 101. Almost everyone on both sides of the aisle believes in the reality of the [Laffer Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve), which posits that there is an optimal tax rate for revenue generation: you can raise taxes up to an optimal point, at which point the taxation becomes too much friction for economic growth and personal motivation, and additional taxes lead to reduced revenues. There's a [blog here](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/reagan-showed-it-can-be-done-lower-top-rate-28-percent-and-raise-more-revenue) on tax rates on capital gains. I don't actually interpret the results the way that they do, because you'll see that after spikes in revenue, capital gains revenue returns to normal.\n\nWhat basically every economist agrees on is that people respond to incentives. As you can see from the chart, capital gains going up produced a huge spike in revenue also, because people re-allocated capital while they could at a lower rate. Lowering it also raised revenue because people re-allocated it after it was freed up. I think many economists would like some sort of middle ground where capital that was re-allocated from investment to investment was tax free, and capital gains liquidated and spent on consumption were taxed as ordinary income.\n\nThat said, this explains why they believe that sometimes, cutting taxes can raise revenue. They believe this is stronger on the richer folks, because they invest and investment creates economic growth. The people on the left tend to believe more in demand-side economics; effectively that when people have money to spend, they spend it, and businesses will respond to that opportunity and invest.\n\nThis is actually very muddy water. For example, [Greg Mankiw](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/) a very prominent economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, is a prominent Keynesian, and wrote:\n\n> \"If you were going to turn to only one economist to understand the problems facing the economy, there is little doubt that the economist would be John Maynard Keynes. Although Keynes died more than a half-century ago, his diagnosis of recessions and depressions remains the foundation of modern macroeconomics. His insights go a long way toward explaining the challenges we now confront.\"\n\nAnd yet, Mankiw was not convinced that the 2008-2009 stimulus was a good idea, whereas other prominent Keynesians like Paul Krugman actually warned that it was the right idea but smaller than it should have been.\n\nAnd Richard Posner, who is a famous jurist and also a prominent academic economist, [rather famously changed his views to be more Keynesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Failure_of_Capitalism) in his book \"A Failure of Capitalism\".\n\nBoth sides have a moral component to their view, as well. The leftist view often draws upon the idea of the [Veil of Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) and suggests that the rich earn their fortunes through a mix of luck, circumstances, and genetics. The right would suggest that economic freedom is critical and that man has a right to the fruits of his own labor, and anything less is tantamount to \"slavery\". (I'm quoting that word because I've read it used in that context many times but can't say it with a straight face without the quotes.)  The right often borrows from the Ayn Rand viewpoint:\n\n> My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n\nThey might argue that the most poor, destitute souls of our society have a lot that is far better than they did a hundred or two hundred years ago, and it is the achievements of great people who have led to that. This might manifest in a desire for policy as close to a flat tax as possible, for example, believing that while we must fund things, we should all contribute equal to our production.\n\nAs far as military spending goes, it is sometimes a tenet on the right that civil and national defense is the primary purpose of government: police and the military effectively being the tool of the government to maintain law and order, and the rest should be left in private hands. So their refusal to cut military spending is consistent with that. There's an obvious counterargument that we spend primarily on proactive \"offense\" than on defense, since we have no real threats directly to our national interests. We do, however, often work to counter threats to our allies around the world, and so there is a counter-counter argument that such spending makes a better world. And of course, reality is muddy. Intervening to stop genocide is probably well and good, and I'm not a fan of a strictly nationalist policy. On the flip side, I absolutely agree with arguments made on both sides that our foreign policy and our use of military creates many enemies, however many threats it counters.\n\n[ Continued in reply.... ]",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>First, it&#39;s important to say that your argument is that &quot;in general, Republicans are hypocrites&quot;, which implies to me that a majority of Republicans are hypocrites. So that&#39;s about half of the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">23-40% of &quot;Republicans&quot;</a>. That&#39;s probably at least 40,000,000 people. That&#39;s a weighty accusation, and you&#39;d probably have had a more defensible position if you argued that some Republican views were hypocritical, because then you might actually have a bunch of Republicans agreeing.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Republicans are a party. Since we have two parties that capture the majority of votes in the country, their platforms will, by necessity, be structured in such a way as to try to rope in a lot of people. Republicans now have at least three clear ideological factions to my eye, those being traditional Goldwater conservatives, tea-party conservatives, and socially conservative religious voters. Those factions don&#39;t even necessarily agree on everything (or anything). So, knowing that many Republicans don&#39;t even agree with their party&#39;s views -- they simply prefer it to the alternative because they highly value some small subset -- are you still comfortable asserting that so many people are, individually, hypocrites?</p>\n\n<p>That said, to address the actual points:</p>\n\n<p>Point #1: Republicans do lay a clam to being a party of small government. However, everything you&#39;ve cited as examples of government intervention are questions for which Republicans are morally motivated. Let&#39;s imagine someone who believes that law and order and protecting the innocent are proper functions of the government; and that intervening economically to help people who can&#39;t help themselves is a function better left to charity. This mindset can easily result in a consistent philosophy that wants the government to intervene when there are victims - whether that is the people who suffer from drug trade, the unborn child/fetus of the woman who wants an abortion, or the invalid who has a right to life even if his spouse wants to end life support. I&#39;m not making an argument that any of these things are immoral. (I even used two terms in the abortion because even the terminology of abortion is completely loaded.)</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, we all have a set of moral beliefs, and we all, in general, believe that the government should legislate morality. Sometimes these beliefs are extremely contentious - such as abortion. Other times, there are times when society as a whole has no problem overriding someone&#39;s individual choices (for example, we&#39;d generally not be shy about overriding a parent&#39;s choice to withhold antibiotics from a sick child, because they believed healing not based on faith was an affront to God).</p>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind that many Republicans in the faction of the religiously motivated voters don&#39;t even particularly <strong>care</strong> about economic policy, realize that when they push for candidates to oppose gay marriage, they are doing it strictly out of a sense that it is a sinful act and inherently immoral, and on that grounds, they feel it is not only acceptable but <strong>necessary</strong> for the government to protect society. I don&#39;t at all agree, but it doesn&#39;t make them hypocrites. Meanwhile, they quite likely care very little for economic policy - or, at most, they have a vague feeling that the government is large and wasteful, but don&#39;t particularly care about the details because they&#39;re voting their morality on social issues regardless.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;d say is that you are seeing their platform views through your own lens. Truth be told, I&#39;ve used that exact same argument before, because I think it <strong>is</strong> persuasive to the non-religious Republican. (I also think the fractured factions of the Republicans are responsible for their being unable to play their role in government effectively, and will ultimately lead to a decline in the party or some sort of platform &quot;purge&quot; that will marginalize at least one of the competing factions.)</p>\n\n<p>Point #2: (Some) Republicans believe that higher taxes stifle growth, especially on people who have money to invest. This is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_side_economics\">supply-side economics</a> 101. Almost everyone on both sides of the aisle believes in the reality of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve\">Laffer Curve</a>, which posits that there is an optimal tax rate for revenue generation: you can raise taxes up to an optimal point, at which point the taxation becomes too much friction for economic growth and personal motivation, and additional taxes lead to reduced revenues.

That said, there is a possibility here that avoids hypocrisy altogether: you can only fight so many battles. The moralists are pouring their time, energy, and money into fighting against abortion and gay marriage. If they can win those fights, they might pursue other policies that align the government closer to a judeo-christian theocracy, but in the team time, they have their hands full. It's easy to find actual individual hypocrites, of course: preachers and conservative politicians caught in scandals involving prostitutes and bathroom stalls are almost laughably common. The rank and file, however, would likely argue that they're not discriminating at all: they just want to uphold moral behavior in society.\n\nPoint #4: Your argument is a bit vague here, and this is probably because \"states' rights\" is so vague. There's some Constitutional history here - the word \"expressly\" was intentionally left out of the 10th Amendment, which reads;\n\n>  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nHad it said \"expressly delegated\", the jurisprudence of the last 200+ years may have been wildly different. Instead, it rubs roughly against the \"Necessary and Proper Clause\" of Article I of the Constitution, which reads:\n\n> The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\nAs such, I think it's dangerous to suggest hypocrisy where the states-rights issues are concerned. Granted, there is inconsistency at times, but those are **very** muddy waters, and hypocrisy is a higher charge than mere inconsistency. It is a deception; and yet states-rights issues are already almost purely the stuff of rhetoric, so finding some manner of sophistry which appears to legitimately support States' Rights in one case but not another isn't hard to do.\n\nPoint #5: This is actually the weakest argument, I'd say: if an unborn child is alive, at whatever stage (whether than is embryonic or moments before birth), then we are talking about protecting the life of an innocent human being. The flip side is that the death penalty is reserved for horrible crimes. One could argue that it is exactly that life is so precious that makes execution of murderers justified; they've committed the ultimate crime. This isn't hypocrisy; it isn't even inconsistent, it is just a wordplay on \"every life is precious\", because the people saying that in the abortion context certainly were not suggesting that the lives of murderers were too precious to take them as punishment.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not a death penalty supporter because statistically, it costs more to execute someone than imprison them for life, and it is clear that innocent people have, and will continue to be, executed. I'd rather lock up 20 guilty men and leave them alive than execute one innocent man -- and that's even assuming I'd want to execute the guilty man even if the cost was small and there was no chance of error. Fortunately, it's a moot point since that isn't the case on either point.\n\nIn conclusion: the Republicans are a group of people you disagree with politically. Some few are demagogues, but they are certainly not \"in general\" hypocrites. This is especially true when you take into account the factions that exist in the republican party, which means that not everyone agrees with all the planks of their typical platform, meaning many Republicans will emphatically desire some plank while being barely tolerant of another, and this is largely the byproduct of a two-party system than any inherent cohesion in their viewpoints.",

Wasting money on an ineffective program is not necessarily good for society, because those resources could be spent more effectively either in other government programs or by people themselves.

Notice how you did NOTHING to backup your infantile, vapid, talking point nonsense and instead just doubled down on it? \n\nHere's a Frederic Bastiat quote that you may find interesting (though more likely you won't understand it or internalize how it applies to you):\n\n>\u201cSocialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\u201d \n\nConservatives think the best way to help people is capitalism and the free market, not inefficient government programs. If you acknowledge that government programs aren't **literally the only way to help people** then you'll see that these simplistic accusations you're making are absurd.\n\n>Except that, as I've shown in detail and you've struggled to refute, neither of these labels is accurate.\n\nI haven't struggled at all. In the context of an abortion, the pro-life position results in more life, the pro-choice position results in more death.",

Notice how you did NOTHING to backup your infantile, vapid, talking point nonsense and instead just doubled down on it? </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a Frederic Bastiat quote that you may find interesting (though more likely you won&#39;t understand it or internalize how it applies to you):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSocialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\u201d </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conservatives think the best way to help people is capitalism and the free market, not inefficient government programs. If you acknowledge that government programs aren&#39;t <strong>literally the only way to help people</strong> then you&#39;ll see that these simplistic accusations you&#39;re making are absurd.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Except that, as I&#39;ve shown in detail and you&#39;ve struggled to refute, neither of these labels is accurate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t struggled at all. In the context of an abortion, the pro-life position results in more life, the pro-choice position results in more death.</p>\n</div>",

I think it supports my point that liberals would be better off by discussing politics with Trump supporters less. Then they might realise where they&#39;ve gone wrong themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or maybe they could keep talking politics but stop calling everything that doesn&#39;t explicitly benefit minorities racist, stop calling everything that isn&#39;t socialist fascist, and then we&#39;ll be able to use those words when someone is actually being a bigot instead of as a weapon to attack people who have different views.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll end with this: you should keep this view as it pertains to you.  You don&#39;t seem genuinely interested in understanding a Trump supporter&#39;s point of view, and I don&#39;t think you can charitably assess American conservatism in its context.  It would be best if you didn&#39;t talk to Trump supporters because all you&#39;ll do is make things worse by antagonizing them on behalf of liberals and centrists like myself.</p>\n</div>",

If someone is marching around your house with a gun saying &quot;I want you to die&quot; are you going to wait until they shoot to act? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>even if a whole ideology rests on violence it doesn&#39;t mean the person advocating it is acting violent, and it doesn&#39;t mean you have the right to silence them with force. They are free to say &quot;I want you to die.&quot; They are not free to say &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you.&quot; That&#39;s the difference between a threat and free speech.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The freedom of speech should be defended, but there is definitely a line. We can use context and history to make a decision that isn&#39;t &quot;well, freedom of speech so whatever&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who gets to decide where the line is? Rights are there to protect all of us. Once you start muting them for different groups who becomes the arbiter of what is protected? Currently the government is that arbiter and they have many checks and balances against abusing this power.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "> [...] They are about preferences and trades and the initial endowments of resources. Why can we apply moral questions to economic distributions but not romantic distributions?\n\nI may be derailing, but I'm pretty sure this is part of the fundament to your opinions.\n\n(Reasonable) moral systems regarding economic distributions seek to settle what you deserve freedom from and freedom to, with regards to desires (products/services) and fears (from unfairness/differences caused by factors beyond personal influence). They seek to give everyone equal opportunity, and everybody disagrees with one system or another. But in a society where every single individual fully subscribes to one system or the other, no member should ever find reasons to complain or stray away from the system.\n\nIn an ideal libertarian society, nobody should complain about any amount of goods and services they get to enjoy. Everybody agrees that they deserve what they work for, and you are not actively holding things back from anybody or taking anything from them. Likewise, in a ideal socialist (or communist) society, everybody shares resources and basically live like a huge family, money may not even be necessary, people just agree on what to do and share all the time. Nobody complains. Nothing is done to harm anyone's desires, or take anything from anybody.\n\nMorals regarding romantic \"distribution\" would be forced to deal with a very significant problem: satisfying  supporters of this hypothetical moral system **in any way at all**, is not guaranteed if they all lived in their own society; sure, you can learn to love someone, but relationships demand consent from both sides; economics do not deal with mutual consent in living together and treating each other like human beings. \n\nAnother major difference is that romance is by default absent, unlike poverty; everyone is born into the exact same state of romance being absent (though not love, which is a much broader term), but chances of varying success. With regards to economic well-being, one can be born into that success, with chances of achieving even more still, but that is not the case with romance. Romance cannot be treated like economics. The product produced is memories, a lifetime of fun and games, a value beyond what an economy can ever produce and radically different by nature; like comparing apples and oranges, but some still prefer one over the other. Many would willingly choose mediocre housing and an everlasting romance with the perfect fit, all in the journey towards a happy life.\n\nTrying to distribute romantic relationships (in order to distribute the benefits of it), through some kind of karma, is unique in how inevitable it is, that someone will have something done **against his/her will**, to him/herself. Even supporters of this moral system, because desires for a partner need not be in alignment with this moral system; we cannot control who we want. Your emotions will never respond well if I point at someone I say will be your partner, when you already know of someone you want. **This moral system will lead to forced marriage, so to speak.** Or alternatively, if you don't want your deserved partner, you get no one. If you don't want the best possible partner that you deserve, you're shit out of luck and have no reason to believe in this moral system anymore.\n\nMoral economic systems only do things *for* people, not against anyone, as long as they stay within their principles. Socialism, by its own principles, does only things to benefit people, not to hurt anyone. Libertarianism also does, while abiding by its principles.\n\nWhatever morals you try to apply to romantic affairs, it is inevitable that some person X will desire person Y, but person Y does not desire person X. This will happen even if both believe in some sort of metric of what they deserve - the problem here is that what they deserve and desire may be completely in conflict, and the moral system does not make any attempts to resolve that. Instead it enforces forced marriage between individuals who do not want each other, and this feeling may result on loathing and overall a bad marriage, and unless you permit divorce, you are not doing anybody any favours. \n\nIf the moral system disregards both individuals' desires, you are going to hurting some people by design of the system, thus the moral system fails at its purposes and there is no reason to keep it.\n\nIf you disregard the desires of only one person, you will inevitably hurt the other; person X might deserve Y but X might not like Y. Again, the moral system fails.\n\nIf you do not disregard either person's desires, then you must respect the fact that it is inevitable that two persons who might deserve each other, want something more. \n\nThe moral system is met with failures even within its own supporter base no matter what. The economic morals have no such failures to acknowledge, because they are in alignment with the principles that underpin them.\n\n____________\n\nHere's one of your opinions flipped around and into a question: is it (in)appropriate to be rewarded for having a good personality? Is it perhaps a reward in and by itself?\n\n>I think that personality is innate or at least unchanging after childhood so if you are fucked up by a traumatic childhood experience there is no hope for you.\n\n>[...] I think that it is equally unjust for someone to have trouble finding an SO because they have a bad personality.\n\nYou really have to make a claim on what is just, in that case.\n\nAnother thought-experiment: we now have two persons whose physical body is completely identical, but one has way worse personality - let's say it's a thoroughly destructive person who revels in the destruction of others' lives. Let's say it's basically a seriously evil twin hellbent on world domination/destruction, and a good twin. Is there any reason to favour the evil twin, barring reasons like masochism and some strange fetish for wickedness?\n\n\nI'd choose the good twin for the following reasons: \n\nThroughout life, we are faced with many decisions, and even daily, there are many decisions that we do not think about for even a second. My experiences are many, ranging from emotional to intellectual. Good things have been done to me. Bad things were done to me. But an eye for an eye, and the whole world goes blind. I decided for myself to be better. Of course, we're all inspired/shaped by some external sources at some point, but the decision is ultimately up to each individual. Nature and nurture both play a role. Your decisions define you as a human. (And your worth/what you deserve, in any sense. Needless to say, Osama bin Laden and his lot would never be considered equal in worth compared to an average human.)\n\nI will condemn the evil twin and preferably never allow this demon a relationship, for the following:\n\nI could have been selfish and justified my actions because of fickle reasons like \"the world was unfair to me, so I will be unfair to the world\". But that is ignorant and foolish. **It is irresponsible and immoral that my wickedness should hurt those who had no say in forming me**, and especially those who had nothing to do with any of it. Even worse, this would be like allowing someone else's evil deeds to trickle through and corrupt me, and potentially others, leaving a vicious spiral. Those who succumb to evil, are not good people, and it is better for everyone that they be enlightened rather than cause further harm of any kind.\n\nA bad personality need not be shaped by bad decisions alone, but I believe that mankind always has the choice to be better, given anything that might change one's mind.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>[...] They are about preferences and trades and the initial endowments of resources. Why can we apply moral questions to economic distributions but not romantic distributions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I may be derailing, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is part of the fundament to your opinions.</p>\n\n<p>(Reasonable) moral systems regarding economic distributions seek to settle what you deserve freedom from and freedom to, with regards to desires (products/services) and fears (from unfairness/differences caused by factors beyond personal influence). They seek to give everyone equal opportunity, and everybody disagrees with one system or another. But in a society where every single individual fully subscribes to one system or the other, no member should ever find reasons to complain or stray away from the system.</p>\n\n<p>In an ideal libertarian society, nobody should complain about any amount of goods and services they get to enjoy. Everybody agrees that they deserve what they work for, and you are not actively holding things back from anybody or taking anything from them. Likewise, in a ideal socialist (or communist) society, everybody shares resources and basically live like a huge family, money may not even be necessary, people just agree on what to do and share all the time. Nobody complains. Nothing is done to harm anyone&#39;s desires, or take anything from anybody.</p>\n\n<p>Morals regarding romantic &quot;distribution&quot; would be forced to deal with a very significant problem: satisfying  supporters of this hypothetical moral system <strong>in any way at all</strong>, is not guaranteed if they all lived in their own society; sure, you can learn to love someone, but relationships demand consent from both sides; economics do not deal with mutual consent in living together and treating each other like human beings. </p>\n\n<p>Another major difference is that romance is by default absent, unlike poverty; everyone is born into the exact same state of romance being absent (though not love, which is a much broader term), but chances of varying success. With regards to economic well-being, one can be born into that success, with chances of achieving even more still, but that is not the case with romance. Romance cannot be treated like economics. The product produced is memories, a lifetime of fun and games, a value beyond what an economy can ever produce and radically different by nature; like comparing apples and oranges, but some still prefer one over the other. Many would willingly choose mediocre housing and an everlasting romance with the perfect fit, all in the journey towards a happy life.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to distribute romantic relationships (in order to distribute the benefits of it), through some kind of karma, is unique in how inevitable it is, that someone will have something done <strong>against his/her will</strong>, to him/herself. Even supporters of this moral system, because desires for a partner need not be in alignment with this moral system; we cannot control who we want. Your emotions will never respond well if I point at someone I say will be your partner, when you already know of someone you want. <strong>This moral system will lead to forced marriage, so to speak.</strong> Or alternatively, if you don&#39;t want your deserved partner, you get no one. If you don&#39;t want the best possible partner that you deserve, you&#39;re shit out of luck and have no reason to believe in this moral system anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Moral economic systems only do things <em>for</em> people, not against anyone, as long as they stay within their principles. Socialism, by its own principles, does only things to benefit people, not to hurt anyone. Libertarianism also does, while abiding by its principles.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever morals you try to apply to romantic affairs, it is inevitable that some person X will desire person Y, but person Y does not desire person X. This will happen even if both believe in some sort of metric of what they deserve - the problem here is that what they deserve and desire may be completely in conflict, and the moral system does not make any attempts to resolve that. Instead it enforces forced marriage between individuals who do not want each other, and this feeling may result on loathing and overall a bad marriage, and unless you permit divorce, you are not doing anybody any favours. </p>\n\n<p>If the moral system disregards both individuals&#39; desires, you are going to hurting some people by design of the system, thus the moral system fails at its purposes and there is no reason to keep it.</p>\n\n<p>If you disregard the desires of only one person, you will inevitably hurt the other; person X might deserve Y but X might not like Y. Again, the moral system fails.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not disregard either person&#39;s desires, then you must respect the fact that it is inevitable that two persons who might deserve each other, want something more. </p>\n\n<p>The moral system is met with failures even within its own supporter base no matter what. The economic morals have no such failures to acknowledge, because they are in alignment with the principles that underpin them.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s one of your opinions flipped around and into a question: is it (in)appropriate to be rewarded for having a good personality? Is it perhaps a reward in and by itself?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that personality is innate or at least unchanging after childhood so if you are fucked up by a traumatic childhood experience there is no hope for you.</p>\n\n<p>[...] I think that it is equally unjust for someone to have trouble finding an SO because they have a bad personality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You really have to make a claim on what is just, in that case.</p>\n\n<p>Another thought-experiment: we now have two persons whose physical body is completely identical, but one has way worse personality - let&#39;s say it&#39;s a thoroughly destructive person who revels in the destruction of others&#39; lives. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s basically a seriously evil twin hellbent on world domination/destruction, and a good twin. Is there any reason to favour the evil twin, barring reasons like masochism and some strange fetish for wickedness?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d choose the good twin for the following reasons: </p>\n\n<p>Throughout life, we are faced with many decisions, and even daily, there are many decisions that we do not think about for even a second. My experiences are many, ranging from emotional to intellectual. Good things have been done to me. Bad things were done to me. But an eye for an eye, and the whole world goes blind. I decided for myself to be better. Of course, we&#39;re all inspired/shaped by some external sources at some point, but the decision is ultimately up to each individual. Nature and nurture both play a role. Your decisions define you as a human. (And your worth/what you deserve, in any sense. Needless to say, Osama bin Laden and his lot would never be considered equal in worth compared to an average human.)</p>\n\n<p>I will condemn the evil twin and preferably never allow this demon a relationship, for the following:</p>\n\n<p>I could have been selfish and justified my actions because of fickle reasons like &quot;the world was unfair to me, so I will be unfair to the world&quot;. But that is ignorant and foolish. <strong>It is irresponsible and immoral that my wickedness should hurt those who had no say in forming me</strong>, and especially those who had nothing to do with any of it. Even worse, this would be like allowing someone else&#39;s evil deeds to trickle through and corrupt me, and potentially others, leaving a vicious spiral. Those who succumb to evil, are not good people, and it is better for everyone that they be enlightened rather than cause further harm of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>A bad personality need not be shaped by bad decisions alone, but I believe that mankind always has the choice to be better, given anything that might change one&#39;s mind. People&#39;s choices later in life is not some sort of awakening of hidden tendencies. Experiences with other people shape us constantly. Good experiences inspire us, evil deeds challenge us. To throw away responsibility of how you are as a sentient, intelligent being, is just childish.</p>\n</div>",

That however is a different debate. </p>\n\n<p>Because property isn&#39;t a real thing which exists in some metaphysical reality, it&#39;s just a concept enforced by the state. Hence there is no &#39;right&#39; to property, and the only form of rights according to property should be those which don&#39;t conflict with the interests of general welfare. </p>\n\n<p>Chile under Pinochet? Oh, they just implemented Milton Friedman and Friederich Hayek&#39;s economic proposals with their personal approval; and totally destroyed the economy, killed about 5,000 people, tortured thousands more, and started a terrorist campaign on three continents. </p>\n</div>",

                "body": "You kind of dilute your argument at the end when you get into the \"success\" of the \"war on terror\", so let me focus on your title and the beginning of your post.\n\nHere's the Merriam Webster definition of terrorism:\n\": the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal\"\n\nTo me, that's pretty clear.  9/11 was terrorism.  They didn't attack strategic targets, they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands.  The same is true of, say, the IRA bombings in London, the Boston Marathon bombing, and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.\n\n> But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group?\n\nWell, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it's fun to kill people, you aren't a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.  If you try to blow up a military base, you aren't a terrorist, you're a guerrilla fighter..  \n\n>Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? \n\nNo.  The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You kind of dilute your argument at the end when you get into the &quot;success&quot; of the &quot;war on terror&quot;, so let me focus on your title and the beginning of your post.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the Merriam Webster definition of terrorism:\n&quot;: the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To me, that&#39;s pretty clear.  9/11 was terrorism.  They didn&#39;t attack strategic targets, they tried to terrorize the US into meeting their demands.  The same is true of, say, the IRA bombings in London, the Boston Marathon bombing, and pretty much any suicide bomber who goes into civilian areas with the intent of killing as many people as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it&#39;s fun to kill people, you aren&#39;t a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.  If you try to blow up a military base, you aren&#39;t a terrorist, you&#39;re a guerrilla fighter..  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No.  The Oklahoma City bombers were terrorists.  So was the Unabomber.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The pursuit of potential terrorists is a different question.  But most people decide that those who attempt to use violent acts to cause fear to achieve political goals are, by definition, terrorists.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s shorthand for &quot;preventing terrorist acts&quot;, and easier than saying, &quot;The war on Al Queda, Al Shabab, the KKK, Hamas, and every other group that wants to commit terrorist acts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is the perfect war.

I think that there are a lot of basic values that most people would agree upon, murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, in essence the NAP. The point I wanted to make is that there are a lot of people that believe they are wholeheartedly right on something when they just can&#39;t know. Abortion is a prime example, on both sides of the issue there are tons of people believing that they are right and not taking it as the complex moral issue it is.</p>\n</div>",

You have someone who has in the past said and done racist things against black people, and you have him more recently saying and doing something that looks pretty damn racist. Is it more likely that he changed his mind about black people and is now doing seemingly racist things for other reasons? Doesn't it seem more likely that he is in fact still racist (especially in the context of other things he has done lately).",

So he has certainly had an opportunity to disavow those remarks, and he never has.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that this was more politically motivated stupidity, not racially motivated stupidity. Considering he hasn&#39;t made similar remarks about other black people in the last 10-5 years as far as I know. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump wasn&#39;t really a political individual at the time (And there haven&#39;t been any other black presidents in the last 5-10 years for him to make such comments about, either, or another person of similar stature).</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, I think you have to consider the context in which this is happening. You have someone who has in the past said and done racist things against black people, and you have him more recently saying and doing something that looks pretty damn racist. Is it more likely that he changed his mind about black people and is now doing seemingly racist things for other reasons? Doesn&#39;t it seem more likely that he is in fact still racist (especially in the context of other things he has done lately).</p>\n</div>",

You can repeat this lie till you are blue in the face, but anyone who sexually exploits a child will always be a pedophile. This is an incredibly obvious attempt to obscure terms for the sake of normalization. That act in and of itself is incredibly skeezy. You should be ashamed of yourself for attempting it.\n\n>Being a pedophile just means your sexual preference is for children.\n\nThis is just another way of saying \"I have a rape desire\". Children can not consent. They have not the experience nor understanding of the act to meaningfully grant it. As well, since they have not gone through puberty, they lack the sexual characteristics to make the act even possible. A child can be penetrated, they can be molested, they can be coerced into a sex act, but they can not have sex. So when you state what you did above, you are either admitting you are too mentally deficient to understand reality, which is mental illness, or you are dressing up your violent urge to assault children, which is mental illness. \"Age\" is not something like Gender. It is a quality that inherently changes in all people. It is a marker for massive physical and mental vulnerability for the young. Being a pedophile just means being an inherent predator.\n\n>I have no interest in rape.\n\nThis could be believable if the concepts of lying and rationalization weren't around. As a pedophile, you are admitting you are an inherent predator. Your word means nothing.\n\n>I don't struggle not to have sex with children. Even if it were legally, socially acceptable, there weren't any ethical concerns, and I were close to LGs, its not like I would immediately try having sex. Unless they were the one to initiate I'd probably do nothing.\n\nAgain, since you are an inherent predator, I can not take your word for it. I'm not willing to risk the rape of a child on your claim of self-denial of what you admit to wanting. If you want others to believe you have no intent on raping a child, submit yourself to psychiatric help for your mental disease until you are rid of it.

It is a quality that inherently changes in all people. It is a marker for massive physical and mental vulnerability for the young. Being a pedophile just means being an inherent predator.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have no interest in rape.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be believable if the concepts of lying and rationalization weren&#39;t around. As a pedophile, you are admitting you are an inherent predator. Your word means nothing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t struggle not to have sex with children. Even if it were legally, socially acceptable, there weren&#39;t any ethical concerns, and I were close to LGs, its not like I would immediately try having sex. Unless they were the one to initiate I&#39;d probably do nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, since you are an inherent predator, I can not take your word for it. I&#39;m not willing to risk the rape of a child on your claim of self-denial of what you admit to wanting. If you want others to believe you have no intent on raping a child, submit yourself to psychiatric help for your mental disease until you are rid of it. That is the only way to prove you are actually a good person.</p>\n</div>",

You are generalizing your personal experience with bullying to the rest of the population when you are the exception, not the norm.\n\nWhen children are made fun of, the vast majority of them do not respond positively.  You think they do because *that's what happened to you.*  \n\n> They make fun of her because that's the only way they know how to bring attention to the issue.\n\nThat, even if it were true, is not acceptable.  That is not the way that adults in society behave themselves, and it is not something that we should be teaching our children.\n\nYou cannot get through to bullies by simply \"Educating them\".  They too have to understand that there are consequences for their actions.  \n\n>They don't think that anyone else sees that Suzy has a problem because if they did, they would be trying to fix it. Some might do this to be mean, but those are by far not the norm.\n\nThis is a fantasy which springs from your romanticized view of what bullying is.  In reality, the groups that are bullying the most are the ones that have problems in their own social life that lead them to having self esteem issues.  They use bullying as a form of validation.  The control that they exert over their weaker peers helps them feel better, it is a form of control that they lack in their home life.  The others are members of a clique that are using their superior social status to make fun of others for their amusement.\n\nNever, in the history of our district, has someone said they were calling suzy fat because they wanted to help her.\n\nLastly, \n\n>to say that making fun of someone who is hurting themselves is as bad as being a skinhead just re-enforces my opinion\n\nI never implied that, and you are creating a strawman.  Teenagers who make fun of people for being gay are using that child's homosexuality in the same way they would use any other aspect of them.  Tom is gay, he's different, so they make fun of him.  Suzy is fat, she's different, so they make fun of her.  They're not bullying because they are neo-nazis, they are bullying to exert social control and feel better about themselves.\n\nYour notion that it is to illicit social change is backed up by nothing at all.  It may, in some outlying cases, result in behavorial change, but the vast majority of these cases result in negative consequences for the victim *regardless of the reasons they are bullied for*.  That is why there is a national campaign to stop bullying.  There have been dozens upon dozens upon dozens of studies done on this subject by experts 'round the USA.  \n\n>Bullying is not a means of \"correcting unacceptable behavior\", because it doesn't meet the requirements to illicit a change in behavior. If you use basic ABA philosophy and methods to look at the behavior of bullying itself, the bully is getting reinforcement from the action of bullying not the victim. Either this is through belittling the individual or the reaction he/she gets from the action he took to make fun of the victim in the first place. This totally doesn't fit into your assertion that it's meant to change undesirable behavior in others, because it doesn't lead to change. It leads to a continuation of the behavior by the bullying because he's reinforced for doing the bullying itself.\n\nThis is the important part of mombo's post, the part I was really hoping you'd read.  There are mountains upon mountains of evidence pointing to bullying as bad, and the only thing you have to say otherwise is \"Well, in my particular case it helped me\".  What is good for you is not good for everyone, necessarily.  Why do you still cling to that ideology?",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>You clearly don&#39;t or you refuse to see the difference between correcting what is an undesirable behavior and what is in fact harassment</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You seem to be under the impression that making fun of Suzy for being Fat and making fun of Suzy for being Gay are two totally separate things and that one is acceptable and the other is not; that one instills social change and the other does not.  You are generalizing your personal experience with bullying to the rest of the population when you are the exception, not the norm.</p>\n\n<p>When children are made fun of, the vast majority of them do not respond positively.  You think they do because <em>that&#39;s what happened to you.</em>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They make fun of her because that&#39;s the only way they know how to bring attention to the issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That, even if it were true, is not acceptable.  That is not the way that adults in society behave themselves, and it is not something that we should be teaching our children.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get through to bullies by simply &quot;Educating them&quot;.  They too have to understand that there are consequences for their actions.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don&#39;t think that anyone else sees that Suzy has a problem because if they did, they would be trying to fix it. Some might do this to be mean, but those are by far not the norm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a fantasy which springs from your romanticized view of what bullying is.  In reality, the groups that are bullying the most are the ones that have problems in their own social life that lead them to having self esteem issues.  They use bullying as a form of validation.  The control that they exert over their weaker peers helps them feel better, it is a form of control that they lack in their home life.  The others are members of a clique that are using their superior social status to make fun of others for their amusement.</p>\n\n<p>Never, in the history of our district, has someone said they were calling suzy fat because they wanted to help her.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>to say that making fun of someone who is hurting themselves is as bad as being a skinhead just re-enforces my opinion</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I never implied that, and you are creating a strawman.  Teenagers who make fun of people for being gay are using that child&#39;s homosexuality in the same way they would use any other aspect of them.  Tom is gay, he&#39;s different, so they make fun of him.  Suzy is fat, she&#39;s different, so they make fun of her.  They&#39;re not bullying because they are neo-nazis, they are bullying to exert social control and feel better about themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Your notion that it is to illicit social change is backed up by nothing at all.

So, you and I would elect him to be president to enact our views perfectly.\n\nHere's the problem; John Oliver shares a lot of views with Candidate A, so many people who would support Candidate A now vote for John Oliver. The votes of a similar band of views is now split between John and Candidate A, meaning they both get fewer total votes. This means that Candidate B wins the election, and the guy we really didn't want is president.\n\nTo avoid this, we vote the most popular choice that agrees the most with us. Admittedly, it's a large problem in US politics right now that needs some change in the future, but it's the system we operate in now and would be in with your change.\n\nEven if we knew we could force whoever we all support to be president, the above scenario would still cause a majority of people to skew towards the most popular choice that is closest to their views in order to avoid someone far more opposed to their views from winning.

Surfing? Nice climate? Smoking weed? And not one of those things are unique to californians. But when you look at Europeans who have hundreds if not thousands of years of rich, defined culture in their countries, I could see how people would be up in arms if they felt that was at risk. And they should be, just as much as if Middle Eastern or Asian or African culture was at risk of being marginalized in those places by white immigrants.

For those reasons I don&#39;t particularly <em>want</em> Europeans to practice nationalism, especially white nationalism, but I also don&#39;t see any other practical recourse for them if they want to maintain a strong culture, which I feel they have a right to be interested in doing. Complaining about this happening in the US is, IMHO, silly. You&#39;re from CA as well and I think we can both agree there&#39;s not a lot of culture for Mexican immigrants to erase. What do we even have? Surfing? Nice climate? Smoking weed? And not one of those things are unique to californians. But when you look at Europeans who have hundreds if not thousands of years of rich, defined culture in their countries, I could see how people would be up in arms if they felt that was at risk. And they should be, just as much as if Middle Eastern or Asian or African culture was at risk of being marginalized in those places by white immigrants. I just don&#39;t see an easy solution in the current climate.</p>\n</div>",

If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.\n\nI think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that \"respect needs to be earned\", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says \"because I said so\" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and \"can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out\". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.\n\nAnd if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just \"agree to disagree\"? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of \"debt\" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.\n\nAnd similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. \"Because I said so\" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where \"because I said so\" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence.

Further, during that time period, child marriages were pretty common, and it would not have been considered immoral in the slightest to have sex with a young girl once she starts puberty, which is usually around age 11 in humans.  I do not say this as a defense to child marriage, but just to provide some context to the discussion.  We cannot judge the actions of a historical figure using modern ethical and moral standards, because ethics and morals are subjective and change over time.\n\nThe Quran, the central religious text of Islam, does not say that homosexual individuals are to be thrown from the roof.  In fact, there are only [four](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/says_about/gay.html) passages specifically mentioning it, none of which mention a specific punishment.  Of note, this is actually relatively minor to the Bible, which has [extensive passages](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/homosexuality.html) in both the Old and New Testament about homosexuality, and explicitly calls for [death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=KJV) to homosexuals.  So, in your words, to be a *good* Christian, one should execute or exile homosexuals.  \n\nThe Bible is also pretty clear on non-Christians as well.  They should be [shunned or put to death](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/nonchristians.html), and that they are all antichrists.  The Bible also says to kill witches, though it does not specify how to identify witches, which was pretty problematic in Salem and led to the deaths of several innocent girls.  The Old Testament is also pretty [brutal](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/rape.html) to rape victims as well.\n\nSomething else that is interesting is that homophobia is not strictly caused by religion.  In [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_South_Korea), LGBT individuals have very little rights, and most of the population there consider homosexuality unfavorably, even though only [54% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Korea) believe in some form of religion, and half of those are Buddhists.  The point I am making here is that it is very likely that even without Islam, many Middle Eastern countries would probably still have some form of penalty for homosexuality, because opposition to it is a *human* reaction, not a religious one. \n\nIf we can live in a nation dominated by Christianity and still be able to pass gay marriage laws, this to me shows that religion is not the thing at fault for oppression and violence.  People are assholes because they are people, not because they believe in religion, which means that it isn't appropriate to judge people exclusively on their beliefs.  ",

What if the question was, \"Would you like to be governed in your current country by Sharia law?\" Saying yes, could lead to the above when paraphrased.\n\nThe comparison between Islam and Christianity has already been mentioned. You (along with most modern Christians) have chosen to emphasise the New Testament (and rightly so!), but that doesn't negate the fact the the Bible still presents examples like God telling Saul to \"put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys\" (1 Samuel 15:3, New International Version). You might claim that this is a minor part and modern Christians don't pay attention to that (or other arguments which we can discuss), but many modern Muslims say the same about their religion.\n\n>Christianity (Focusing very much so, as christianity does, on the new testament) is a religion that is almost as pacifistic as Buddhism\n\nThis is your belief as a person (Christian?) in this era. You can't make the same claim for all Christians even in recent history. If you did, then why couldn't a peaceful Muslim make the same claim for Muslims today since [Christians are still killing Muslims.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/central-african-republic-christian-militias-revenge)\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that the Crusades killed many people in the name of Christianity. Do you think people from that era would have thought Christianity was as pacifist as you view it? \n\nJesus himself said, \"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" (Matthew 10:34, NIV). Every argument you make against a claim that this promotes violence can be made with respect to the Quoran.\n\n\nIn terms of a religion being out of date, how do you define this while not maintaining that all religion is out of date? Wasn't Christianity out of date from the moment Galileo was persecuted because he said that the Earth wasn't the center of the universe? Not to mention the advocacy of Creationism, not Evolution being taught in schools (such as in the US). \n\nIf you go back 70 years, slavery and Christianity went hand-in-hand. [Slaves were told to serve their masters as if they were serving God.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery) Not to mention how many churches treat the LGBT community.",

You (along with most modern Christians) have chosen to emphasise the New Testament (and rightly so!), but that doesn&#39;t negate the fact the the Bible still presents examples like God telling Saul to &quot;put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys&quot; (1 Samuel 15:3, New International Version). You might claim that this is a minor part and modern Christians don&#39;t pay attention to that (or other arguments which we can discuss), but many modern Muslims say the same about their religion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Christianity (Focusing very much so, as christianity does, on the new testament) is a religion that is almost as pacifistic as Buddhism</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is your belief as a person (Christian?) in this era. You can&#39;t make the same claim for all Christians even in recent history. If you did, then why couldn&#39;t a peaceful Muslim make the same claim for Muslims today since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/central-african-republic-christian-militias-revenge\">Christians are still killing Muslims.</a></p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that the Crusades killed many people in the name of Christianity. Do you think people from that era would have thought Christianity was as pacifist as you view it? </p>\n\n<p>Jesus himself said, &quot;Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.&quot; (Matthew 10:34, NIV). Every argument you make against a claim that this promotes violence can be made with respect to the Quoran.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of a religion being out of date, how do you define this while not maintaining that all religion is out of date? Wasn&#39;t Christianity out of date from the moment Galileo was persecuted because he said that the Earth wasn&#39;t the center of the universe? Not to mention the advocacy of Creationism, not Evolution being taught in schools (such as in the US). </p>\n\n<p>If you go back 70 years, slavery and Christianity went hand-in-hand. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery\">Slaves were told to serve their masters as if they were serving God.</a> Not to mention how many churches treat the LGBT community.</p>\n</div>",

So preserve the status quo (regardless of it's oppressiveness) to maintain stability? Then all Islamic countries should keep Islam in to maintain stability. Therefore, it is not outdated. It is just not beneficial to countries where Muslims are a minority. Additionally, you cannot argue this while arguing against the way women are treated in Muslim countries since this is their \"status quo\". Also by extension, since we don't want to abolish the \"status quo\", then we can't get rid of Islam and we can't get rid of the resulting conflict since it is currently the \"status quo\".\n\n4. Yes, Christianity is...ahem...evolving, but evolution takes time.

Raising up standard of living for people who live worse than they would like to is admirable, but Capitalist economies cannot function without some sort of inequality.

It is essential to your claims that people deserve to start off equal, but what about the 15 year old kids who end up in jail for doing stupid things, what about the guy who got hooked on heroin and finally got off of at at age 30?

Now I am not making a Reaganomics argument, I am just saying that if this incentive is taken away, people wont be as pressured to work for a pittance in a service industry job, employers will have to pay more in order to attract the, no longer in an effective surplus, labor, and if they intend to maintain their profits prices must rise.\n\nThere would be some recuperation of the loss of the value of the dollar in the economic stimulus that would occur, but I am unconvinced that the economy can be fixed to not disadvantage anyone.  Unless the state makes sure business don't raise prices and take profit loss, and then makes sure that investors don't pull their investments and put them in non-US markets, it would be devastating.

They get funding and direction, but can operate in whatever way they see fit.  The only true means a local government control is whether to dissolve the police force or not by pulling purse strings.  They have no control over non-local governments (sheriff, FBI, State police etc).\n\n>Joes like you and I can run for local government.\n\nI see.  And how does that change the government?

We have polluted the government so far that we still think we can change things, but things always continue to happen regardless of who is in power.  \n\nThink about it for a minute.  There has been a huge outcry against the NSA.  People were up in arms about it.  We called on our government to shut it down, to dismantle it.  We kicked out politicians who supported it.  So it's gone now, right?  Hell, we don't even have constitutional equal rights for all people.  Today, on MLK day, we still have to pass a bill every few years to guarantee the freedom to vote for everyone.  Why does this need to be extended?  Why is there a sunset provision on granting all people the right to vote?  Because nothing ever changes in favor of the people.  We've change politicians.  We protested.  And what happened?  Exactly nothing.\n\nAnd what makes this all the scariest?  There is no oversight.  The government is allowed to hide things from us.  In the middle of the night, you could be whisked away in your sleep and put into a holding cell somewhere.  Certainly your family would call the police and say that you were gone.  But who are the police?  Another arm of the government.  They'll throw you into a giant unsolved bin and continue on tagging speeders, jailing potheads, and writing reports.  You can rot in a cell and regardless of your constitutional rights, you can sit there and no one will know.  You die in a cell, without anyone ever knowing where you went.\n\nIs it more likely that you will be accused of rape that getting abducted in the middle of the night?  Absolutely.  But which is the worse scenario and what should you be more afraid of?  If you piss off the wrong person, you disappear for life.\n\nBut we should look at likely scenarios, right?  If you shoot someone, you go to jail - regardless of how clear cut a scenario it is.  You are guilty until presumed innocent by the district attorney.  The police can hold you, without cause for a full day and then if they have cause, they can continue to hold you.  However, if you are shot by an officer everything changes.  They are innocent until proven guilty.  They don't go to jail, they usually don't even face civil charges unless someone can prove that they did it maliciously.  In most cases, their Union prevents criminal charges in place of them just losing their job.  This is at nearly all levels.  Did that officer think that you were grabbing an object that looked like a gun while grabbing your insurance from your glove box?  You die, he gets paid leave.  Guy looks like he's pulling a gun from his waist and you shoot in fear for your life?  Jail, manslaughter.  \n\nIf you think that we the people can fix the government, why is it so broken?\n\nYou would think the last 200 years  of \"we the people\" would have fixed the problems that the government keeps creating.  If we are truly to blame for the government in its current state, what makes you think that we are capable of fixing it?",

                "body": ">Can you elaborate, what are \"gun free zones\" in America, and how they are reinforced?\n\nGun free zones literally consist of a sign, either on the front of the building (like for a movie theater) or right outside the premises (a university). 99% of the time, enforcement is non-existent. But, because most gun owners are really careful to obey the law due to heavy penalties for gun-related crimes, and not wanting to stigmatize gun ownership further, they obey the signs anyway, or take their business elsewhere. The last 1% are in really violent cities where entrances to schools have metal detectors installed. They seem to me like little more than a virtue signal by democrats. Some states don't give the signs legal authority beyond trespassing.\n\n>What would you say, what kinds of policy changes would you endorse?\n\nEDIT: I agree that there is a violence problem in America. That much is evident due to the 5x increase in homicides over most European countries despite a similar culture. I just don't think restricting guns via the law is the answer, especially since guns are already plentiful. Bear with me, as this may start sounding racey. 70-80% of homicides are committed with a firearm, while over 50% of homicides are committed by blacks. Much of this is then drug related. This **does not** mean they're violent because of their race. However, it's a probable outcome when you combine a 72% out of wedlock birth rate, a high poverty rate, the drug trade; and confine them all to a single community. Things I think would help:\n\n1. This anti-police bias has to stop. Officers have just as much aversion to being called a racist as anyone else. They're becoming so scared of public humiliation, they're avoiding black neighborhoods. Thing is, those are typically poor neighborhoods where the crime happens. It's called the Ferguson effect, after the shooting of Michael Brown; a police shooting in 2014 that was completely justifiable by every possible analysis. Regardless, BLM still heavily protested it. The effect is starting to be statistically relevant, as 2015 saw a 10% increase in homicides. Might be coincidence, might not, but homicides were falling for the previous 8 years.\n\n2. Stop the war on drugs. Seems counter-intuitive, I know. In poor communities, the men are often put in prison for very long sentences due to 3-strikes laws, that vastly increase a prison sentence after 3 offences. This is causing men that would otherwise be fathers to be absent when their children are growing up. The mothers are (sadly) just keeping the kids around for welfare reasons, so the kids go out and try to get money the only way they know how in their community, by selling drugs. Drugs being a very dirty business with lots of money at stake, lots of people are killed in the process. \n\n3. We need to stop stop endorsing gang culture. People are very sympathetic when someone gets shot. When a woman has a child out of wedlock? No problem. When a black woman is spunky and physically abuses her child? No problem. When a suspicious number of black celebrities say they do everything to support their mother? No problem. It'll be hard for me to explain it without sounding racist, but if you have time and are genuinely curious, this interview explains it well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE-urLVdI-8\n4. Federally ban gun-free zones being enforced by states via a 2nd amendment argument. Another hard sell, but it might help curb mass shootings. ~10% of people have concealed carry permits in states that allow them. That's a 1/10 chance on every teacher, movie-goer, or university student to become an armed defender if SHTF.\n>I am not American, so I am not sure what kind of background checks you already do, but I would do endorse something like that. If you are a suspected of terrorism and prohibited from flying, maybe no one should be able to legally sell you an assault rifle.\n\nIt's federal law in the U.S. to get a background check on every purchase from a store. If it's a transaction between two people within state lines, no background check is required except in 10 states & D.C. The NICS (National Instant background Check System) is what conducts this check, and is computerized, so only takes a few minutes. This denies anyone with a felony, drug addiction, or domestic abuse record. I don't know why it doesn't cover terror suspects. The media almost always ignores the existence of this background check though because it's so fast. There are some funny exceptions though: http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/21/reporter-tries-buying-assault-rifle-to-show-how-easy-it-is-fails/",
