      "\n",
      "the selfawareness of a creature makes no difference to how it experiences pain and pleasure they are evolutionary urges laid down to encourage certain behaviours both the human and the dog would want to get out of the box if anything the dog is in a worse position as it has less capacity to envision an end to the pain having a concept of suffering does not make the physical pain you experience any more intense nor does being selfaware \n",
      "\n",
      "the upshot from this argument is that most utilitarians argue that inflicting pain on an organism is in most cases worse than killing it as you have said if something doesnt have a sense of self then it cant have an interest in perpetuating its self however creatures which feel pain can most definitely have an interest in avoiding it even without a sense of self this is why animals should be treated kindly and where possible pain should not be inflicted on them it is also why the experiment with the box would not be repeated today thankfully\n",

      "\n",
      "the second part to that answer is about what personal choice is personal choice is only relevant in the initial consent andor any consent change that may happen throughout and until the end of the act if retroactive consent is relevant then personal choice is allowed of course you may personally decide to choose that the act even though it was done without initial consent was ok for you and you grant retroactive consent to the act or you may personally decide to choose that the act was not ok for you and breaches the terms of the initial consent either way its a personal choice what personal choice is not is a decision made without any breach in initial consent after the act is completed\n",

      "\n",
      " the court today holds that warren mccleskeys sentence was constitutionally imposed it finds no fault in a system in which lawyers must tell their clients that race casts a large shadow on the capital sentencing process \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " the baldus study indicates that after taking into account some 230 nonracial factors that might legitimately influence a sentencer the jury more likely than not would have spared mccleskeys life had his victim been black the study distinguishes between those cases in which 1 the jury exercises virtually no discretion because the strength or weakness of aggravating factors usually suggests that only one outcome is appropriate  and 2 cases reflecting an intermediate level of aggravation in which the jury has considerable discretion in choosing a sentence  mccleskeys case falls into the intermediate range in such cases death is imposed in 34 of whitevictim crimes and 14 of blackvictim crimes a difference of 139 in the rate of imposition of the death penalty supp exh 54 in other words just under 59  almost 6 in 10  defendants comparable to mccleskey would not have received the death penalty if their victims had been black  \n",
      "\n",
      " furthermore even examination of the sentencing system as a whole factoring in those cases in which the jury exercises little discretion indicates the influence of race on capital sentencing for the georgia system as a whole race accounts for a six percentage point difference in the rate at which capital punishment is imposed since death is imposed in 11 of all whitevictim cases the rate in comparably aggravated blackvictim cases is 5 the rate of capital sentencing in a whitevictim case is thus 120 greater than the rate in a blackvictim case put another way over half  55  of defendants in whitevictim crimes in georgia would not have been sentenced to die if their victims had been black of the more than 200 variables potentially relevant to a sentencing decision race of the victim is a powerful explanation for variation in death sentence rates  as powerful as nonracial aggravating factors such as a prior murder conviction or acting as the principal planner of the homicide  \n",

      " these adjusted figures are only the most conservative indication of the risk that race will influence the death sentences of defendants in georgia data unadjusted for the mitigating or aggravating effect of other factors show an even more pronounced disparity by race the capital sentencing rate for all whitevictim cases was almost 11 times greater than the rate for blackvictim cases furthermore blacks who kill whites are sentenced to death at nearly 22 times the rate of blacks who kill blacks and more than 7 times the rate of whites who kill blacks ibid in addition prosecutors seek the death penalty for 70 of black defendants with white victims but for only 15 of black defendants with black victims and only 19 of white defendants with black victims since our decision upholding the georgia capital sentencing system in gregg the state has executed seven persons all of the seven were convicted of killing whites and six of the seven executed were black   such execution figures are especially striking in light of the fact that during the period encompassed by the baldus study only 92 of georgia homicides involved black defendants and white victims while 607 involved black victims\n",

      "i agree that if we define western in the very specific useless and agenda driven way youve defined it then first nationals wouldnt be considered westerners i also agree that since the earth is basically a sphere it has no true east or west\n",
      "\n",
      "however i have no reason to accept your definition of western over mine so first nationals are westerners and though the earth is basically a sphere maps are flat and are clearly split in euroamerican centered maps east and west in addition to that since there is a place labeled the middle east we can assume that there are generally accepted east and west regions if we consider america a western country then we gotta include  mexico and that includes their indigenous people and if we include mexicos indigenous people then we gotta include first nations people too \n",
      "\n",
      "therefore first nationals are westerners\n",
      "first of all its bad form to put something in quotes when its not actually a quote more specifically when you probably have never even seen or read a quran in your life     \n",
      "anyway lets talk about practicality for a moment and leave your moralizing by the way side for the time being first economics america really doesnt have the economic might or fortitude to simultaneously commit to destroying and then restructuring the entire middle east iraq and afghanistan and 14 years of war has proven that fact no country can go into another country and attempt to change it successfully they will be seen as conquerors regardless of their intentions and vehemently opposed as has been proven throughout history if the peoples of the middle east wish to change they must do it to have the movement have any legitimacy at all we can not change it for them       \n",
      "now strategically there is no winwin scenario there if we remove who ever is in power regardless of how brutal they are that will leave a power vacuum in the area which will be filled by the next more brutal group as can be evidenced by alqaeda and subsequently isilisis and these groups arent naïve upstarts either they are all battlehardened from years of combat stretching farther back than the soviet occupation of afghanistan      \n",
      "furthermore the american people are warweary after seeing a quick operation to target alqaeda turn into a war of attrition with the taliban that stretched on to be the longest war in american history we simply dont have the stomach for it anymore and thats not even speaking of the mostly silent active duty and veteran community who has taken the brunt of the trauma from such a campaign       \n",
      "the rest of this seems vaguely racist and purposefully inflammatory and suggesting what amounts to a genocidal act none of which seems particularly ethical to me       \n",
      "theres a lot of dynamics going on and changing in the middle east at the moment and it you specify your concerns i will address them as best i can\n",

      "edit incidentally i went to a muslim book store a few years ago and bought a copy of both the koran and hadith in english and have read several parts of them  ive also studied the bible but i feel like many that its unfair that i have to be culpable for knowing these books better than the people who claim to believe in them and its difficult to memorize significant quantities of them and furthermore i dont have the same desire or impetus for said memorization given that i dont actually believe they are the truth\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not appreciate being labeled a racist or that i desire or intend genocide i was hoping to qualify things i was saying enough to make both of those points very clear but i guess it wasnt clear enough\n",
      "\n",
      "incidentally its not racist to think an ideology is bad and islam is an ideology i dont think the hindu caste system is good but similarly i dont think its as bad as the muslim ideology both groups are by and large from the same racialethic groupsregions but i think both of them are pretty bad i also think the white evangelical christians are equally bad as are the white supremacist neo nazi folks and i would consider a world police force to be just as responsible for corralling those groups as well\n",
      "\n",
      "on to your points  sorry about the bad form i didnt desire to take the time to look up a dozen some odd actual quotes from the koranhadith which i could easily do to support my point i was trying to indicate that it was a summation of what is said and to my understanding its pretty common knowledge that this type of stuff is present in these books maybe i should have used brackets instead i guess\n",
      "\n",
      "that we dont actually have the economic ability and that we are already war weary i think are probably some of the better points relating to why we should not do such a thing\n",
      "\n",
      "as far as whats going on and addressing my concerns i guess my concern is sort of that simple old question of how do we bring peace to the middle east and more specifically should anyone even try also is peace in the middle east an oxymoron\n",
      "\n",
      "i consider myself effectively liberaldemocratic but i tend to differ with most of my liberal friendscolleagues on one primary point which is that i dont entirely disagree with the fact that the west has a military presence in the middle east because i have lately been under the impression that the threat of the muslim ideology is a fair bit more real than most folks would like to admit at the very least i feel pretty um knarly i dunno a good word when i think of the human rights abuses like killing little girls atheists gays women etc and i personally would like to see that change and i think a reasonable option would be some kind of world police presence but im interested in various rationales that this might not actually be a good idea or even possible\n",
      "\n",
      "so far youve presented at least two of the more compelling ideas as to why maybe the west shouldnt try to be world peace keepers\n",
      "\n",
      "i guess my main concern is how does one reconcile just letting the situation run its course from an ethical standpoint is it simply that though it would be nice we cant spread ourselves that thin and take that much risk\n",
      "\n",
      "if we did have the capacity would there be other reasons this would be bad also what are the dynamics really like with these cultures  i mean is it just that weve only given money to the wackos are the middle eastern cultures really as horrendous as theyre often portrayed in the media are they really as peaceful as the moderate christian neighbors in rural america\n",
