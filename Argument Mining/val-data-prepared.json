I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.Thanks in advance.EDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!  You guys pointed out some clearly fallacious opinions I had and also showed me a multitude of other views on the issue.  This is a very personal issue that only pertains to my own beliefs and not something I go around spouting to others.  This was a good learning experience for myself, so again thank you all.  I have deltas to those I felt really stuck with the discussion, but I'd like to thank you all for commenting.I guess my question for you would be: what is inherently wrong with seeking attention?If you're doing so in a way that takes away from others, I can see the problem: e.g., if you're one of those people who feels the need to one-up *every* story at a party, you might need to learn to chill out and share the spotlight.But if your contributions are welcome and socially appropriate (e.g., you're not spamming the subreddit with new posts), then why does the \"attention seeking\" (if that's what it is) strike you as being a problem?Like I said, I have no problem with it, ",
