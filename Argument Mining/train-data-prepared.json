I suppose I hadn't really though to consider the complexities of a \"shitty-Shep\" in relation to the flaws of the game itself.The absence of certain characters is valid too, even though losing squadmembers would be more somber than I'd personally prefer.Almost poetic in a way, but I think I'll stick to going the long way around if I'm going to invest any time in another (one of at least five runs since it came out, btw) full Mass Effect runthrough. ;)I suppose I should have mentioned that this would be in the case of a person doing a \"final\" canon run for THEIR Shep, and making those decisions on who to save and what to do.",
